The designer recognizes that the amount of farmland matters. One should expect <strong>the more acres, the more complaints</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Let&#39;s consider computing directly the number of complaints per million acres.</p>\r\n<p>The resulting chart (shown below right) – while retaining the design – gives a wholly different feeling. Arkansas now owns the largest bubble even though it has the least acreage among the included states. The huge Illinois bubble is still large but is no longer a loner.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints1\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints1\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Now return to the original design for a moment (the chart on the left). In theory, this should work in the following manner: if complaints grow purely as a function of acreage, then the bubbles should grow proportionally from left to right. The trouble is that <strong>proportional areas are not as easily detected as proportional lengths</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The pair of charts below depict made-up data in which all states have 30 complaints for each million acres of farmland. It’s not intuitive that the bubbles on the left chart are growing proportionally.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Now if you look at the right chart, which shows the relative metric of complaints per million acres, it’s impossible not to notice that all bubbles are the same size.</p>",

The huge Illinois bubble is still large but is no longer a loner.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints1\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints1\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Now return to the original design for a moment (the chart on the left). In theory, this should work in the following manner: if complaints grow purely as a function of acreage, then the bubbles should grow proportionally from left to right. The trouble is that <strong>proportional areas are not as easily detected as proportional lengths</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The pair of charts below depict made-up data in which all states have 30 complaints for each million acres of farmland. It’s not intuitive that the bubbles on the left chart are growing proportionally.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Now if you look at the right chart, which shows the relative metric of complaints per million acres, it’s impossible not to notice that all bubbles are the same size.</p>",

It is not a default chart that pops out of software.</p>\r\n<p>Based on its design, we surmise that the designer has the following intentions:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The names of the medical procedures are printed to be read, thus the long text is placed horizontally.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>The actual price is not as important as the <strong>relative price</strong>, expressed as an<strong> index with the U.S. price at 100%</strong>. These reference values are printed in glaring red, unignorable.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>Notwithstanding the above point, the actual price is still of secondary importance, and the values are provided as a supplement to the row labels. Getting to the actual prices in the comparison countries requires further effort, and a calculator.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>The primary comparison is between the U.S. and the rest of the world (or the group of seven countries included). It is less important to distinguish specific countries in the comparison group, and thus the non-U.S. dots are given pastels that take some effort to differentiate.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>Probably due to reader feedback, the font size is subject to a minimum so that some labels are split into two lines to prevent the text from dominating the plotting region.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>Trifecta Checkup</strong> <a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup\">view</a> of the world, there is no single best design. The best design depends on the intended message and what’s in the available data.</p>\r\n<p>To illustate this, I will present a few variants of the above design, and discuss how these alternative designs reflect the designer&#39;s intentions.</p>\r\n<p>Note that in all my charts, I expressed the relative price in terms of discounts, which is the mirror image of premiums. Instead of saying Country A&#39;s price is 80% of the U.S. price, I prefer to say Country A&#39;s price is a 20% saving (or discount) off the U.S. price.</p>\r\n<p>First up is the following chart that emphasizes countries instead of hospital procedures:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b66200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_medicalprice_hor_dot\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b66200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b66200d-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_medicalprice_hor_dot\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This chart encourages readers to draw conclusions such as &quot;Hospital prices are 60-80 percent cheaper in Holland relative to the U.S.&quot; But it is more taxing to compare the cost of a specific procedure across countries.</p>\r\n<p>The indexing strategy already creates a barrier to understanding relative costs of a specific procedure. For example, the value for angioplasty in Australia is about 55% and in Switzerland, about 75%. The difference 75%-55% is meaningless because both numbers are relative savings from the U.S. baseline.

It is not a default chart that pops out of software.</p>\r\n<p>Based on its design, we surmise that the designer has the following intentions:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The names of the medical procedures are printed to be read, thus the long text is placed horizontally.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>The actual price is not as important as the <strong>relative price</strong>, expressed as an<strong> index with the U.S. price at 100%</strong>. These reference values are printed in glaring red, unignorable.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>Notwithstanding the above point, the actual price is still of secondary importance, and the values are provided as a supplement to the row labels. Getting to the actual prices in the comparison countries requires further effort, and a calculator.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>The primary comparison is between the U.S. and the rest of the world (or the group of seven countries included). It is less important to distinguish specific countries in the comparison group, and thus the non-U.S. dots are given pastels that take some effort to differentiate.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>Probably due to reader feedback, the font size is subject to a minimum so that some labels are split into two lines to prevent the text from dominating the plotting region.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>Trifecta Checkup</strong> <a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup\">view</a> of the world, there is no single best design. The best design depends on the intended message and what’s in the available data.</p>\r\n<p>To illustate this, I will present a few variants of the above design, and discuss how these alternative designs reflect the designer&#39;s intentions.</p>\r\n<p>Note that in all my charts, I expressed the relative price in terms of discounts, which is the mirror image of premiums. Instead of saying Country A&#39;s price is 80% of the U.S. price, I prefer to say Country A&#39;s price is a 20% saving (or discount) off the U.S. price.</p>\r\n<p>First up is the following chart that emphasizes countries instead of hospital procedures:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b66200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_medicalprice_hor_dot\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b66200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b66200d-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_medicalprice_hor_dot\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This chart encourages readers to draw conclusions such as &quot;Hospital prices are 60-80 percent cheaper in Holland relative to the U.S.&quot; But it is more taxing to compare the cost of a specific procedure across countries.</p>\r\n<p>The indexing strategy already creates a barrier to understanding relative costs of a specific procedure. For example, the value for angioplasty in Australia is about 55% and in Switzerland, about 75%. The difference 75%-55% is meaningless because both numbers are relative savings from the U.S. baseline. Comparing Australia and Switzerland requires a ratio (0.75/0.55 = 1.36): Australia&#39;s prices are 36% above Swiss prices, or alternatively, Swiss prices are a<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"> 64%</span> 26% discount off Australia&#39;s prices.</p>\r\n<p>The following design takes it even further, excluding details of individual procedures:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b62200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_medicalprice_hor_bar\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b62200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4d83b62200d-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_medicalprice_hor_bar\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>For some readers, less is more.

(Just a reminder, here is the chart we&#39;re dealing with.)</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Ar_submit_Fig-3-2-The-policy-cost-curve-525\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Ar_submit_Fig-3-2-The-policy-cost-curve-525\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>First, I&#39;m very concerned about the long program names. I see their proper placement in a horizontal orientation as a <strong>hard constraint</strong> on the design. I&#39;d reject every design that displays the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/text\" title=\"Posts about text\">text</a> vertically, at an angle, or hides it behind some hover effect, or abbreviates or abridges the text.</p>\r\n<p>Second, I strongly suggest re-thinking the &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot; metric on the vertical axis. Flipping the sign of this metric makes a return-on-investment-type metric, which is much more intuitive. Just to reiterate a prior point, it feels odd to be selecting more negative projects before more positive projects.</p>\r\n<p>Third, I&#39;d like to decide what metrics to place on the two axes. There are three main possibilities: a) benefits (that is, the average annual emissions abatement shown on the horizontal axis currently), b) costs, and c) some function that ties together costs and benefits (currently, this design uses cost per unit benefit, and calls it cost effectivness but there are a variety of similar metrics that can be defined).</p>\r\n<p>For each of these metrics, there is a secondary choice. I can use the by-project value or the cumulative value. The cumulative value is dependent on a selection order, in this case, determined by the criterion of selecting from the most cost-effective program to the least (regardless of project size or any other criteria).</p>\r\n<p>This is where I&#39;d bring in the <strong>Trifecta Checkup</strong> framework (see <a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup Junkcharts\">here</a> for a guide).</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" /></a><br />The decision of which metrics to use on the axes means I&#39;m operating in the &quot;D&quot; corner. But this decision must be made with respect to the &quot;Q&quot; corner, thus the green arrow between the two. Which two metrics are the most relevant depends on what we want the chart to accomplish. That in turn depends on the audience and what specific question we are addressing for them.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, if the purpose of the chart is exploratory - that is to say, we use it to guide decision-makers in choosing a subset of programs, then I would want to introduce an element of <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/interactive\" title=\"posts about interactive charts\">interactivity</a>. Imagine an interface that allows the user to move programs in and out of the chart, while the chart updates itself to compute the total costs and total benefits.</p>\r\n<p>This last point ties together the entire <strong>Trifacta Checkup</strong> framework (<a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup Junkcharts\">link</a>). The <strong>Question</strong> being exploratory in nature suggests a certain way of organizing and analyzing the <strong>Data</strong> as well as a <strong>Visual</strong> form that facilitates interacting with the information.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

The cumulative value is dependent on a selection order, in this case, determined by the criterion of selecting from the most cost-effective program to the least (regardless of project size or any other criteria).</p>\r\n<p>This is where I&#39;d bring in the <strong>Trifecta Checkup</strong> framework (see <a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup Junkcharts\">here</a> for a guide).</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" /></a><br />The decision of which metrics to use on the axes means I&#39;m operating in the &quot;D&quot; corner. But this decision must be made with respect to the &quot;Q&quot; corner, thus the green arrow between the two. Which two metrics are the most relevant depends on what we want the chart to accomplish. That in turn depends on the audience and what specific question we are addressing for them.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, if the purpose of the chart is exploratory - that is to say, we use it to guide decision-makers in choosing a subset of programs, then I would want to introduce an element of <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/interactive\" title=\"posts about interactive charts\">interactivity</a>. Imagine an interface that allows the user to move programs in and out of the chart, while the chart updates itself to compute the total costs and total benefits.</p>\r\n<p>This last point ties together the entire <strong>Trifacta Checkup</strong> framework (<a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup Junkcharts\">link</a>). The <strong>Question</strong> being exploratory in nature suggests a certain way of organizing and analyzing the <strong>Data</strong> as well as a <strong>Visual</strong> form that facilitates interacting with the information.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

After examining it, I nominate it for the Hall of Shame.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The chart has three major components vying for our attention: (1) the stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">columns</a>, (2) the yellow <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/line_chart\" title=\"Posts about line charts\">line</a>, and (3) the big red dashed arrow.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest to interpret is the yellow line, which is labeled &quot;Total&quot; in the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/legend\" title=\"Posts about legend\">legend</a>. It displays the annual growth rate of car sales around the globe. The data consist of annual percentage changes in car sales, so the slope of the yellow line represents a change of change, which is not particularly useful.</p>\r\n<p>The big red arrow is making the point that the projected decline in global car sales in 2019 will return the world to the slowdown of 2008-9 after almost a decade of growth.</p>\r\n<p>The stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about column charts\">columns</a> appear to provide a breakdown of the global growth rate by region. Looked at carefully, you&#39;ll soon learn that the visual form has hopelessly mangled the data.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d-pi\" style=\"float: left;\"><img alt=\"Cnbc_globalcarsales_2006\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d-150wi\" style=\"width: 150px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border: 4px solid #FFFFFF;\" title=\"Cnbc_globalcarsales_2006\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>What is the growth rate for Chinese car sales in 2006? Is it 2.5%, the top edge of China&#39;s part of the column? Between 1.5% and 2.5%, the extant of China&#39;s section? The answer is neither. Because of the stacking, China&#39;s growth rate is actually the height of the relevant section, that is to say, 1 percent. So the labels on the vertical <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"Posts about axis\">axis</a> are not directly useful to learning regional growth rates for most sections of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>Can we read the vertical axis as global growth rate? That&#39;s not proper either. The different markets are not equal in size so growth rates cannot be <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/aggregation\" title=\"Posts about aggregation\">aggregated</a> by simple summing - they must be weighted by relative size.</p>\r\n<p>The negative growth rates present another problem. Even if we agree to sum growth rates ignoring relative market sizes, we still can&#39;t get directly to the global growth rate. We would have to take the total of the positive rates and subtract the total of the negative rates. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>At this point, you may begin to question everything you thought you knew about this chart. Remember the yellow line, which we thought measures the global growth rate. Take a look at the 2006 column again.</p>\r\n<p>The global growth rate is depicted as 2 percent. And yet every region experienced growth rates below 2 percent! No matter how you aggregate the regions, it&#39;s not possible for the world average to be larger than the value of each region.</p>\r\n<p>For 2006, the regional growth rates are: China, 1%; Rest of the World, 1%; Western Europe, 0.1%; United States, -0.25%. A simple sum of those four rates yields 2%, which is shown on the yellow line.</p>\r\n<p>But this number must be divided by four. If we give the four regions equal weight, each is worth a quarter of the total. So the overall average is the sum of each growth rate weighted by 1/4, which is 0.5%. [In reality, the weights of each region should be scaled to reflect its market size.]</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>tldr; The stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about column charts\">column chart</a> with a line overlay not only fails to communicate the contents of the car sales data but it also leads to misinterpretation.</p>\r\n<p>I discussed several serious problems of this chart form:&#0160;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>stacking the columns make it hard to learn the regional data<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>the trend by region takes a super effort to decipher<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>column stacking promotes reading meaning into the height of the column but the total height is meaningless (because of the negative section) while the net height (positive minus negative) also misleads due to presumptive equal weighting<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>the yellow line shows the sum of the regional data, which is four times the global growth rate that it purports to represent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>PS.

After examining it, I nominate it for the Hall of Shame.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The chart has three major components vying for our attention: (1) the stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">columns</a>, (2) the yellow <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/line_chart\" title=\"Posts about line charts\">line</a>, and (3) the big red dashed arrow.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest to interpret is the yellow line, which is labeled &quot;Total&quot; in the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/legend\" title=\"Posts about legend\">legend</a>. It displays the annual growth rate of car sales around the globe. The data consist of annual percentage changes in car sales, so the slope of the yellow line represents a change of change, which is not particularly useful.</p>\r\n<p>The big red arrow is making the point that the projected decline in global car sales in 2019 will return the world to the slowdown of 2008-9 after almost a decade of growth.</p>\r\n<p>The stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about column charts\">columns</a> appear to provide a breakdown of the global growth rate by region. Looked at carefully, you&#39;ll soon learn that the visual form has hopelessly mangled the data.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d-pi\" style=\"float: left;\"><img alt=\"Cnbc_globalcarsales_2006\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d-150wi\" style=\"width: 150px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border: 4px solid #FFFFFF;\" title=\"Cnbc_globalcarsales_2006\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>What is the growth rate for Chinese car sales in 2006? Is it 2.5%, the top edge of China&#39;s part of the column? Between 1.5% and 2.5%, the extant of China&#39;s section? The answer is neither. Because of the stacking, China&#39;s growth rate is actually the height of the relevant section, that is to say, 1 percent. So the labels on the vertical <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"Posts about axis\">axis</a> are not directly useful to learning regional growth rates for most sections of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>Can we read the vertical axis as global growth rate? That&#39;s not proper either. The different markets are not equal in size so growth rates cannot be <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/aggregation\" title=\"Posts about aggregation\">aggregated</a> by simple summing - they must be weighted by relative size.</p>\r\n<p>The negative growth rates present another problem. Even if we agree to sum growth rates ignoring relative market sizes, we still can&#39;t get directly to the global growth rate. We would have to take the total of the positive rates and subtract the total of the negative rates. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>At this point, you may begin to question everything you thought you knew about this chart. Remember the yellow line, which we thought measures the global growth rate. Take a look at the 2006 column again.</p>\r\n<p>The global growth rate is depicted as 2 percent. And yet every region experienced growth rates below 2 percent! No matter how you aggregate the regions, it&#39;s not possible for the world average to be larger than the value of each region.</p>\r\n<p>For 2006, the regional growth rates are: China, 1%; Rest of the World, 1%; Western Europe, 0.1%; United States, -0.25%. A simple sum of those four rates yields 2%, which is shown on the yellow line.</p>\r\n<p>But this number must be divided by four. If we give the four regions equal weight, each is worth a quarter of the total. So the overall average is the sum of each growth rate weighted by 1/4, which is 0.5%. [In reality, the weights of each region should be scaled to reflect its market size.]</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>tldr; The stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about column charts\">column chart</a> with a line overlay not only fails to communicate the contents of the car sales data but it also leads to misinterpretation.</p>\r\n<p>I discussed several serious problems of this chart form:&#0160;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>stacking the columns make it hard to learn the regional data<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>the trend by region takes a super effort to decipher<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>column stacking promotes reading meaning into the height of the column but the total height is meaningless (because of the negative section) while the net height (positive minus negative) also misleads due to presumptive equal weighting<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>the yellow line shows the sum of the regional data, which is four times the global growth rate that it purports to represent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>PS.

So the graphical element for each program is a vertical column coupled with a horizontal label that invades the territories of the next few programs. Like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_fueleconomystandardscars\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_fueleconomystandardscars\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The horror of this design constraint is fully realized in the following chart, a similar design produced for the state of Oregon (lifted from the Plan Washington webpage listed as a resource below):</p>\r\n<p><strong><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Figure 2 oregon greenhouse\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Figure 2 oregon greenhouse\" /></a></strong></p>\r\n<p>In a re-design, horizontal labeling should be a priority.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Realizing that I&#39;ve been distracted by the text labels, back to the horizontal <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"posts about axes\">axis</a> I went.</p>\r\n<p>This is where I encountered the next roadblock.</p>\r\n<p>The axis title says &quot;Average Annual Emissions Abatement&quot; measured in millions metric tons. The unit matches the second part of the vertical scale, which is comforting. But how does one reconcile the widths of columns with a continuous scale? I was expecting each program to have a projected annual abatement benefit, and those would fall as dots on a line, like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_dotplot\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_dotplot\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Instead, we have line segments sitting on a line, like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_annuallabel\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_annuallabel\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Think of these bars as the bottom edges of the columns. These line segments can be better compared to each other if structured as a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar and column charts\">bar chart</a>:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Instead, the design arranges these lines end-to-end.</p>\r\n<p>To unravel this mystery, we go back to the objective of the chart, as announced by the book reviewer. Here it is again:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>policy-makers can focus on the areas which make the most difference in emissions, while also being mindful of the cost issues that can be so important in getting political buy-in.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The primary goal of the chart is a <strong>decision-making tool for policy-makers</strong> who are evaluating programs. Each program has a cost and also a benefit. The cost is shown on the vertical axis and the benefit is shown on the horizontal. The decision-maker will select some subset of these programs based on the cost-benefit analysis. That subset of programs will have a projected <em>total</em> expected benefit (CO2 abatement) and a projected total cost.</p>\r\n<p>By stacking the line segments end to end on top of the horizontal axis, the chart designer elevates the task of computing the <em>total</em> benefits of a subset of programs, relative to the task of learning the benefits of any individual program. Thus, the horizontal axis is better labeled &quot;Cumulative annual emissions abatement&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Look at that axis again. Imagine you are required to learn the specific benefit of program titled &quot;Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs&quot;. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_cumlabel\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_cumlabel\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This is impossible to do without pulling out a ruler and a calculator. What the axis labels do tell us is that if all the programs to the left of Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs were adopted, the cumulative benefits would be 285 million metric tons of CO2 per year. And if Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs were also implemented, the cumulative benefits would rise to 375 million metric tons.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>At long last, we have arrived at a reasonable interpretation of the cost-benefit chart.</p>\r\n<p>Policy-makers are considering throwing their support behind specific programs aimed at abating CO2 emissions. Different organizations have come up with different ways to achieve this goal. This goal may even have specific benchmarks; the government may have committed to an international agreement, for example, to reduce emissions by some set amount by 2030. Each candidate abatement program is evaluated on both cost and benefit dimensions. Benefit is given by the amount of CO2 abated. Cost is measured as a &quot;marginal cost,&quot; the amount of dollars required to achieve each million metric ton of abatement.</p>\r\n<p>This &quot;<strong>marginal abatement cost curve</strong>&quot; aids the decision-making. It lines up the programs from the most cost-effective to the least cost-effective. The decision-maker is presumed to prefer a more cost-effective program than a less cost-effective program. The chart answers the following question: for any given subset of programs (so long as we select them left to right contiguously), we can read off the cumulative amount of CO2 abated.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>There are still more limitations of the chart design.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We can&#39;t directly read off the cumulative cost of the selected subset of programs because the vertical axis is not cumulative. The cumulative cost turns out to be the <strong>total area</strong> of all the columns that correspond to the selected programs. (Area is height x width, which is cost per benefit multiplied by benefit, which leaves us with the cost.) Unfortunately, it takes rulers and calculators to compute this total area.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>We have presumed that policy-makers will make the Go-No-go decision based on cost effectiveness alone</strong>. This point of view has already been contradicted. Remember the mystery around negatively cost-effective programs - their existence shows that some programs are stalled even when they reduce emissions in addition to making money!<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>Since many, if not most, programs have negative cost-effectiveness (by the way they measured it), I&#39;d flip the metric over and call it profitability (or return on investment). Doing so removes another barrier to our understanding. With the current cost-effectiveness metric, policy-makers are selecting the &quot;negative&quot; programs before the &quot;positive&quot; programs. <strong>It makes more sense to select the &quot;positive&quot; programs before the &quot;negative&quot; ones!</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In a <strong>Trifecta Checkup </strong>(<a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup\">guide</a>), I rate this chart <strong>Type V</strong>. The chart has a great purpose, and the design reveals a keen sense of the decision-making process. It&#39;s not a data dump for sure. In addition, an impressive amount of data gathering and analysis - and synthesis - went into preparing the two data series required to construct the chart. (Sure, for something so subjective and speculative, the analysis methodology will inevitably be challenged by wonks.) Those two data series are reasonable measures for the stated purpose of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>The chart form, though, has various shortcomings, as shown here. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In our email exchange, Antonio and I found the Plan Washington <a href=\"http://planwashington.org/blog/archive/understanding-carbon-reduction-marginal-abatement-cost-curves/\" title=\"Link to Plan Washington\">website</a> useful. This is where we learned that this chart is called the marginal abatement cost curve.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the consulting firm McKinsey is responsible for popularizing this chart form. They have published this long <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/reducing-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions\" title=\"link to Mckinsey\">report</a> that explains even more of the analysis behind constructing this chart, for those who want further details.</p>",

Like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_fueleconomystandardscars\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_fueleconomystandardscars\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The horror of this design constraint is fully realized in the following chart, a similar design produced for the state of Oregon (lifted from the Plan Washington webpage listed as a resource below):</p>\r\n<p><strong><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Figure 2 oregon greenhouse\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Figure 2 oregon greenhouse\" /></a></strong></p>\r\n<p>In a re-design, horizontal labeling should be a priority.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Realizing that I&#39;ve been distracted by the text labels, back to the horizontal <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"posts about axes\">axis</a> I went.</p>\r\n<p>This is where I encountered the next roadblock.</p>\r\n<p>The axis title says &quot;Average Annual Emissions Abatement&quot; measured in millions metric tons. The unit matches the second part of the vertical scale, which is comforting. But how does one reconcile the widths of columns with a continuous scale? I was expecting each program to have a projected annual abatement benefit, and those would fall as dots on a line, like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_dotplot\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_dotplot\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Instead, we have line segments sitting on a line, like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_annuallabel\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_annuallabel\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Think of these bars as the bottom edges of the columns. These line segments can be better compared to each other if structured as a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar and column charts\">bar chart</a>:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Instead, the design arranges these lines end-to-end.</p>\r\n<p>To unravel this mystery, we go back to the objective of the chart, as announced by the book reviewer. Here it is again:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>policy-makers can focus on the areas which make the most difference in emissions, while also being mindful of the cost issues that can be so important in getting political buy-in.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The primary goal of the chart is a <strong>decision-making tool for policy-makers</strong> who are evaluating programs. Each program has a cost and also a benefit. The cost is shown on the vertical axis and the benefit is shown on the horizontal. The decision-maker will select some subset of these programs based on the cost-benefit analysis. That subset of programs will have a projected <em>total</em> expected benefit (CO2 abatement) and a projected total cost.</p>\r\n<p>By stacking the line segments end to end on top of the horizontal axis, the chart designer elevates the task of computing the <em>total</em> benefits of a subset of programs, relative to the task of learning the benefits of any individual program. Thus, the horizontal axis is better labeled &quot;Cumulative annual emissions abatement&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Look at that axis again. Imagine you are required to learn the specific benefit of program titled &quot;Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs&quot;. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_cumlabel\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_cumlabel\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This is impossible to do without pulling out a ruler and a calculator. What the axis labels do tell us is that if all the programs to the left of Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs were adopted, the cumulative benefits would be 285 million metric tons of CO2 per year. And if Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs were also implemented, the cumulative benefits would rise to 375 million metric tons.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>At long last, we have arrived at a reasonable interpretation of the cost-benefit chart.</p>\r\n<p>Policy-makers are considering throwing their support behind specific programs aimed at abating CO2 emissions. Different organizations have come up with different ways to achieve this goal. This goal may even have specific benchmarks; the government may have committed to an international agreement, for example, to reduce emissions by some set amount by 2030. Each candidate abatement program is evaluated on both cost and benefit dimensions. Benefit is given by the amount of CO2 abated. Cost is measured as a &quot;marginal cost,&quot; the amount of dollars required to achieve each million metric ton of abatement.</p>\r\n<p>This &quot;<strong>marginal abatement cost curve</strong>&quot; aids the decision-making. It lines up the programs from the most cost-effective to the least cost-effective. The decision-maker is presumed to prefer a more cost-effective program than a less cost-effective program. The chart answers the following question: for any given subset of programs (so long as we select them left to right contiguously), we can read off the cumulative amount of CO2 abated.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>There are still more limitations of the chart design.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We can&#39;t directly read off the cumulative cost of the selected subset of programs because the vertical axis is not cumulative. The cumulative cost turns out to be the <strong>total area</strong> of all the columns that correspond to the selected programs. (Area is height x width, which is cost per benefit multiplied by benefit, which leaves us with the cost.) Unfortunately, it takes rulers and calculators to compute this total area.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>We have presumed that policy-makers will make the Go-No-go decision based on cost effectiveness alone</strong>. This point of view has already been contradicted. Remember the mystery around negatively cost-effective programs - their existence shows that some programs are stalled even when they reduce emissions in addition to making money!<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>Since many, if not most, programs have negative cost-effectiveness (by the way they measured it), I&#39;d flip the metric over and call it profitability (or return on investment). Doing so removes another barrier to our understanding. With the current cost-effectiveness metric, policy-makers are selecting the &quot;negative&quot; programs before the &quot;positive&quot; programs. <strong>It makes more sense to select the &quot;positive&quot; programs before the &quot;negative&quot; ones!</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In a <strong>Trifecta Checkup </strong>(<a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup\">guide</a>), I rate this chart <strong>Type V</strong>. The chart has a great purpose, and the design reveals a keen sense of the decision-making process. It&#39;s not a data dump for sure. In addition, an impressive amount of data gathering and analysis - and synthesis - went into preparing the two data series required to construct the chart. (Sure, for something so subjective and speculative, the analysis methodology will inevitably be challenged by wonks.) Those two data series are reasonable measures for the stated purpose of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>The chart form, though, has various shortcomings, as shown here. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In our email exchange, Antonio and I found the Plan Washington <a href=\"http://planwashington.org/blog/archive/understanding-carbon-reduction-marginal-abatement-cost-curves/\" title=\"Link to Plan Washington\">website</a> useful. This is where we learned that this chart is called the marginal abatement cost curve.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the consulting firm McKinsey is responsible for popularizing this chart form. They have published this long <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/reducing-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions\" title=\"link to Mckinsey\">report</a> that explains even more of the analysis behind constructing this chart, for those who want further details.</p>",

This graphic displays geographical and time changes simultaneously.</p>\r\n<p>The staircase chart shows weeds have become resistant to Roundup over time. This is considered a weakness in the Roundup business.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In this post, my focus is on the chart at the bottom, which shows complaints about Dicamba by state in 2019. This is a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bubble_chart\" title=\"Posts about bubble charts\">bubble chart</a>, with the bubbles <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/sorting\" title=\"Posts about order\">sorted</a> along the horizontal <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"Posts about axes\">axis</a> by the acreage of farmland by state.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a50194c5200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Wsj_roundup_img2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a50194c5200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a50194c5200b-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Wsj_roundup_img2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Below left is a more standard version of such a chart, in which the bubbles are allowed to overlap. (I only included the bubbles that were labeled in the original chart).</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5f2200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_roundupwsj0\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5f2200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5f2200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_roundupwsj0\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The WSJ’s twist is to use the vertical spacing to avoid overlapping bubbles. The vertical <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"Posts about axes\">axis</a> serves a design perogative and does not encode data. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>I’m going to stick with the more traditional overlapping bubbles here – I’m getting to a different matter.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>question</strong> being addressed by this chart is: which states have the most serious Dicamba problem, as revealed by the frequency of complaints? The designer recognizes that the amount of farmland matters. One should expect <strong>the more acres, the more complaints</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Let&#39;s consider computing directly the number of complaints per million acres.</p>\r\n<p>The resulting chart (shown below right) – while retaining the design – gives a wholly different feeling. Arkansas now owns the largest bubble even though it has the least acreage among the included states. The huge Illinois bubble is still large but is no longer a loner.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints1\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints1\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Now return to the original design for a moment (the chart on the left). In theory, this should work in the following manner: if complaints grow purely as a function of acreage, then the bubbles should grow proportionally from left to right. The trouble is that <strong>proportional areas are not as easily detected as proportional lengths</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The pair of charts below depict made-up data in which all states have 30 complaints for each million acres of farmland. It’s not intuitive that the bubbles on the left chart are growing proportionally.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Now if you look at the right chart, which shows the relative metric of complaints per million acres, it’s impossible not to notice that all bubbles are the same size.</p>",

This graphic displays geographical and time changes simultaneously.</p>\r\n<p>The staircase chart shows weeds have become resistant to Roundup over time. This is considered a weakness in the Roundup business.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In this post, my focus is on the chart at the bottom, which shows complaints about Dicamba by state in 2019. This is a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bubble_chart\" title=\"Posts about bubble charts\">bubble chart</a>, with the bubbles <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/sorting\" title=\"Posts about order\">sorted</a> along the horizontal <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"Posts about axes\">axis</a> by the acreage of farmland by state.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a50194c5200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Wsj_roundup_img2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a50194c5200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a50194c5200b-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Wsj_roundup_img2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Below left is a more standard version of such a chart, in which the bubbles are allowed to overlap. (I only included the bubbles that were labeled in the original chart).</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5f2200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_roundupwsj0\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5f2200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5f2200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_roundupwsj0\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The WSJ’s twist is to use the vertical spacing to avoid overlapping bubbles. The vertical <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"Posts about axes\">axis</a> serves a design perogative and does not encode data. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>I’m going to stick with the more traditional overlapping bubbles here – I’m getting to a different matter.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>question</strong> being addressed by this chart is: which states have the most serious Dicamba problem, as revealed by the frequency of complaints? The designer recognizes that the amount of farmland matters. One should expect <strong>the more acres, the more complaints</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Let&#39;s consider computing directly the number of complaints per million acres.</p>\r\n<p>The resulting chart (shown below right) – while retaining the design – gives a wholly different feeling. Arkansas now owns the largest bubble even though it has the least acreage among the included states. The huge Illinois bubble is still large but is no longer a loner.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints1\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c5cf200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints1\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Now return to the original design for a moment (the chart on the left). In theory, this should work in the following manner: if complaints grow purely as a function of acreage, then the bubbles should grow proportionally from left to right. The trouble is that <strong>proportional areas are not as easily detected as proportional lengths</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The pair of charts below depict made-up data in which all states have 30 complaints for each million acres of farmland. It’s not intuitive that the bubbles on the left chart are growing proportionally.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b3c650200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Redo_dicambacomplaints2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Now if you look at the right chart, which shows the relative metric of complaints per million acres, it’s impossible not to notice that all bubbles are the same size.</p>",

It is not a default chart that pops out of software.</p>\r\n<p>Based on its design, we surmise that the designer has the following intentions:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The names of the medical procedures are printed to be read, thus the long text is placed horizontally.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>The actual price is not as important as the <strong>relative price</strong>, expressed as an<strong> index with the U.S. price at 100%</strong>.

(Just a reminder, here is the chart we&#39;re dealing with.)</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Ar_submit_Fig-3-2-The-policy-cost-curve-525\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Ar_submit_Fig-3-2-The-policy-cost-curve-525\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>First, I&#39;m very concerned about the long program names. I see their proper placement in a horizontal orientation as a <strong>hard constraint</strong> on the design. I&#39;d reject every design that displays the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/text\" title=\"Posts about text\">text</a> vertically, at an angle, or hides it behind some hover effect, or abbreviates or abridges the text.</p>\r\n<p>Second, I strongly suggest re-thinking the &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot; metric on the vertical axis. Flipping the sign of this metric makes a return-on-investment-type metric, which is much more intuitive. Just to reiterate a prior point, it feels odd to be selecting more negative projects before more positive projects.</p>\r\n<p>Third, I&#39;d like to decide what metrics to place on the two axes. There are three main possibilities: a) benefits (that is, the average annual emissions abatement shown on the horizontal axis currently), b) costs, and c) some function that ties together costs and benefits (currently, this design uses cost per unit benefit, and calls it cost effectivness but there are a variety of similar metrics that can be defined).</p>\r\n<p>For each of these metrics, there is a secondary choice. I can use the by-project value or the cumulative value. The cumulative value is dependent on a selection order, in this case, determined by the criterion of selecting from the most cost-effective program to the least (regardless of project size or any other criteria).</p>\r\n<p>This is where I&#39;d bring in the <strong>Trifecta Checkup</strong> framework (see <a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup Junkcharts\">here</a> for a guide).</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" /></a><br />The decision of which metrics to use on the axes means I&#39;m operating in the &quot;D&quot; corner. But this decision must be made with respect to the &quot;Q&quot; corner, thus the green arrow between the two. Which two metrics are the most relevant depends on what we want the chart to accomplish. That in turn depends on the audience and what specific question we are addressing for them.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, if the purpose of the chart is exploratory - that is to say, we use it to guide decision-makers in choosing a subset of programs, then I would want to introduce an element of <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/interactive\" title=\"posts about interactive charts\">interactivity</a>. Imagine an interface that allows the user to move programs in and out of the chart, while the chart updates itself to compute the total costs and total benefits.</p>\r\n<p>This last point ties together the entire <strong>Trifacta Checkup</strong> framework (<a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup Junkcharts\">link</a>). The <strong>Question</strong> being exploratory in nature suggests a certain way of organizing and analyzing the <strong>Data</strong> as well as a <strong>Visual</strong> form that facilitates interacting with the information.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

(Just a reminder, here is the chart we&#39;re dealing with.)</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Ar_submit_Fig-3-2-The-policy-cost-curve-525\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4129200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Ar_submit_Fig-3-2-The-policy-cost-curve-525\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>First, I&#39;m very concerned about the long program names. I see their proper placement in a horizontal orientation as a <strong>hard constraint</strong> on the design. I&#39;d reject every design that displays the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/text\" title=\"Posts about text\">text</a> vertically, at an angle, or hides it behind some hover effect, or abbreviates or abridges the text.</p>\r\n<p>Second, I strongly suggest re-thinking the &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot; metric on the vertical axis. Flipping the sign of this metric makes a return-on-investment-type metric, which is much more intuitive. Just to reiterate a prior point, it feels odd to be selecting more negative projects before more positive projects.</p>\r\n<p>Third, I&#39;d like to decide what metrics to place on the two axes. There are three main possibilities: a) benefits (that is, the average annual emissions abatement shown on the horizontal axis currently), b) costs, and c) some function that ties together costs and benefits (currently, this design uses cost per unit benefit, and calls it cost effectivness but there are a variety of similar metrics that can be defined).</p>\r\n<p>For each of these metrics, there is a secondary choice. I can use the by-project value or the cumulative value. The cumulative value is dependent on a selection order, in this case, determined by the criterion of selecting from the most cost-effective program to the least (regardless of project size or any other criteria).</p>\r\n<p>This is where I&#39;d bring in the <strong>Trifecta Checkup</strong> framework (see <a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup Junkcharts\">here</a> for a guide).</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4aa4160200c-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" /></a><br />The decision of which metrics to use on the axes means I&#39;m operating in the &quot;D&quot; corner. But this decision must be made with respect to the &quot;Q&quot; corner, thus the green arrow between the two. Which two metrics are the most relevant depends on what we want the chart to accomplish. That in turn depends on the audience and what specific question we are addressing for them.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, if the purpose of the chart is exploratory - that is to say, we use it to guide decision-makers in choosing a subset of programs, then I would want to introduce an element of <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/interactive\" title=\"posts about interactive charts\">interactivity</a>. Imagine an interface that allows the user to move programs in and out of the chart, while the chart updates itself to compute the total costs and total benefits.</p>\r\n<p>This last point ties together the entire <strong>Trifacta Checkup</strong> framework (<a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup Junkcharts\">link</a>). The <strong>Question</strong> being exploratory in nature suggests a certain way of organizing and analyzing the <strong>Data</strong> as well as a <strong>Visual</strong> form that facilitates interacting with the information.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

After examining it, I nominate it for the Hall of Shame.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The chart has three major components vying for our attention: (1) the stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">columns</a>, (2) the yellow <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/line_chart\" title=\"Posts about line charts\">line</a>, and (3) the big red dashed arrow.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest to interpret is the yellow line, which is labeled &quot;Total&quot; in the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/legend\" title=\"Posts about legend\">legend</a>. It displays the annual growth rate of car sales around the globe. The data consist of annual percentage changes in car sales, so the slope of the yellow line represents a change of change, which is not particularly useful.</p>\r\n<p>The big red arrow is making the point that the projected decline in global car sales in 2019 will return the world to the slowdown of 2008-9 after almost a decade of growth.</p>\r\n<p>The stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about column charts\">columns</a> appear to provide a breakdown of the global growth rate by region. Looked at carefully, you&#39;ll soon learn that the visual form has hopelessly mangled the data.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d-pi\" style=\"float: left;\"><img alt=\"Cnbc_globalcarsales_2006\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d-150wi\" style=\"width: 150px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border: 4px solid #FFFFFF;\" title=\"Cnbc_globalcarsales_2006\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>What is the growth rate for Chinese car sales in 2006? Is it 2.5%, the top edge of China&#39;s part of the column? Between 1.5% and 2.5%, the extant of China&#39;s section? The answer is neither. Because of the stacking, China&#39;s growth rate is actually the height of the relevant section, that is to say, 1 percent. So the labels on the vertical <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"Posts about axis\">axis</a> are not directly useful to learning regional growth rates for most sections of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>Can we read the vertical axis as global growth rate? That&#39;s not proper either. The different markets are not equal in size so growth rates cannot be <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/aggregation\" title=\"Posts about aggregation\">aggregated</a> by simple summing - they must be weighted by relative size.</p>\r\n<p>The negative growth rates present another problem. Even if we agree to sum growth rates ignoring relative market sizes, we still can&#39;t get directly to the global growth rate. We would have to take the total of the positive rates and subtract the total of the negative rates. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>At this point, you may begin to question everything you thought you knew about this chart. Remember the yellow line, which we thought measures the global growth rate. Take a look at the 2006 column again.</p>\r\n<p>The global growth rate is depicted as 2 percent. And yet every region experienced growth rates below 2 percent! No matter how you aggregate the regions, it&#39;s not possible for the world average to be larger than the value of each region.</p>\r\n<p>For 2006, the regional growth rates are: China, 1%; Rest of the World, 1%; Western Europe, 0.1%; United States, -0.25%. A simple sum of those four rates yields 2%, which is shown on the yellow line.</p>\r\n<p>But this number must be divided by four. If we give the four regions equal weight, each is worth a quarter of the total. So the overall average is the sum of each growth rate weighted by 1/4, which is 0.5%. [In reality, the weights of each region should be scaled to reflect its market size.]</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>tldr; The stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about column charts\">column chart</a> with a line overlay not only fails to communicate the contents of the car sales data but it also leads to misinterpretation.</p>\r\n<p>I discussed several serious problems of this chart form:&#0160;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>stacking the columns make it hard to learn the regional data<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>the trend by region takes a super effort to decipher<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>column stacking promotes reading meaning into the height of the column but the total height is meaningless (because of the negative section) while the net height (positive minus negative) also misleads due to presumptive equal weighting<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>the yellow line shows the sum of the regional data, which is four times the global growth rate that it purports to represent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>PS.

After examining it, I nominate it for the Hall of Shame.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The chart has three major components vying for our attention: (1) the stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">columns</a>, (2) the yellow <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/line_chart\" title=\"Posts about line charts\">line</a>, and (3) the big red dashed arrow.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest to interpret is the yellow line, which is labeled &quot;Total&quot; in the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/legend\" title=\"Posts about legend\">legend</a>. It displays the annual growth rate of car sales around the globe. The data consist of annual percentage changes in car sales, so the slope of the yellow line represents a change of change, which is not particularly useful.</p>\r\n<p>The big red arrow is making the point that the projected decline in global car sales in 2019 will return the world to the slowdown of 2008-9 after almost a decade of growth.</p>\r\n<p>The stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about column charts\">columns</a> appear to provide a breakdown of the global growth rate by region. Looked at carefully, you&#39;ll soon learn that the visual form has hopelessly mangled the data.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d-pi\" style=\"float: left;\"><img alt=\"Cnbc_globalcarsales_2006\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cd15b4200d-150wi\" style=\"width: 150px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border: 4px solid #FFFFFF;\" title=\"Cnbc_globalcarsales_2006\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>What is the growth rate for Chinese car sales in 2006? Is it 2.5%, the top edge of China&#39;s part of the column? Between 1.5% and 2.5%, the extant of China&#39;s section? The answer is neither. Because of the stacking, China&#39;s growth rate is actually the height of the relevant section, that is to say, 1 percent. So the labels on the vertical <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"Posts about axis\">axis</a> are not directly useful to learning regional growth rates for most sections of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>Can we read the vertical axis as global growth rate? That&#39;s not proper either. The different markets are not equal in size so growth rates cannot be <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/aggregation\" title=\"Posts about aggregation\">aggregated</a> by simple summing - they must be weighted by relative size.</p>\r\n<p>The negative growth rates present another problem. Even if we agree to sum growth rates ignoring relative market sizes, we still can&#39;t get directly to the global growth rate. We would have to take the total of the positive rates and subtract the total of the negative rates. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>At this point, you may begin to question everything you thought you knew about this chart. Remember the yellow line, which we thought measures the global growth rate. Take a look at the 2006 column again.</p>\r\n<p>The global growth rate is depicted as 2 percent. And yet every region experienced growth rates below 2 percent! No matter how you aggregate the regions, it&#39;s not possible for the world average to be larger than the value of each region.</p>\r\n<p>For 2006, the regional growth rates are: China, 1%; Rest of the World, 1%; Western Europe, 0.1%; United States, -0.25%. A simple sum of those four rates yields 2%, which is shown on the yellow line.</p>\r\n<p>But this number must be divided by four. If we give the four regions equal weight, each is worth a quarter of the total. So the overall average is the sum of each growth rate weighted by 1/4, which is 0.5%. [In reality, the weights of each region should be scaled to reflect its market size.]</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>tldr; The stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about column charts\">column chart</a> with a line overlay not only fails to communicate the contents of the car sales data but it also leads to misinterpretation.</p>\r\n<p>I discussed several serious problems of this chart form:&#0160;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>stacking the columns make it hard to learn the regional data<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>the trend by region takes a super effort to decipher<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>column stacking promotes reading meaning into the height of the column but the total height is meaningless (because of the negative section) while the net height (positive minus negative) also misleads due to presumptive equal weighting<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>the yellow line shows the sum of the regional data, which is four times the global growth rate that it purports to represent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>PS.

So the graphical element for each program is a vertical column coupled with a horizontal label that invades the territories of the next few programs. Like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_fueleconomystandardscars\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_fueleconomystandardscars\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The horror of this design constraint is fully realized in the following chart, a similar design produced for the state of Oregon (lifted from the Plan Washington webpage listed as a resource below):</p>\r\n<p><strong><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Figure 2 oregon greenhouse\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Figure 2 oregon greenhouse\" /></a></strong></p>\r\n<p>In a re-design, horizontal labeling should be a priority.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Realizing that I&#39;ve been distracted by the text labels, back to the horizontal <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"posts about axes\">axis</a> I went.</p>\r\n<p>This is where I encountered the next roadblock.</p>\r\n<p>The axis title says &quot;Average Annual Emissions Abatement&quot; measured in millions metric tons. The unit matches the second part of the vertical scale, which is comforting. But how does one reconcile the widths of columns with a continuous scale? I was expecting each program to have a projected annual abatement benefit, and those would fall as dots on a line, like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_dotplot\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_dotplot\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Instead, we have line segments sitting on a line, like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_annuallabel\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_annuallabel\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Think of these bars as the bottom edges of the columns. These line segments can be better compared to each other if structured as a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar and column charts\">bar chart</a>:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Instead, the design arranges these lines end-to-end.</p>\r\n<p>To unravel this mystery, we go back to the objective of the chart, as announced by the book reviewer. Here it is again:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>policy-makers can focus on the areas which make the most difference in emissions, while also being mindful of the cost issues that can be so important in getting political buy-in.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The primary goal of the chart is a <strong>decision-making tool for policy-makers</strong> who are evaluating programs. Each program has a cost and also a benefit. The cost is shown on the vertical axis and the benefit is shown on the horizontal. The decision-maker will select some subset of these programs based on the cost-benefit analysis. That subset of programs will have a projected <em>total</em> expected benefit (CO2 abatement) and a projected total cost.</p>\r\n<p>By stacking the line segments end to end on top of the horizontal axis, the chart designer elevates the task of computing the <em>total</em> benefits of a subset of programs, relative to the task of learning the benefits of any individual program. Thus, the horizontal axis is better labeled &quot;Cumulative annual emissions abatement&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Look at that axis again. Imagine you are required to learn the specific benefit of program titled &quot;Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs&quot;. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_cumlabel\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_cumlabel\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This is impossible to do without pulling out a ruler and a calculator. What the axis labels do tell us is that if all the programs to the left of Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs were adopted, the cumulative benefits would be 285 million metric tons of CO2 per year. And if Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs were also implemented, the cumulative benefits would rise to 375 million metric tons.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>At long last, we have arrived at a reasonable interpretation of the cost-benefit chart.</p>\r\n<p>Policy-makers are considering throwing their support behind specific programs aimed at abating CO2 emissions. Different organizations have come up with different ways to achieve this goal. This goal may even have specific benchmarks; the government may have committed to an international agreement, for example, to reduce emissions by some set amount by 2030. Each candidate abatement program is evaluated on both cost and benefit dimensions. Benefit is given by the amount of CO2 abated. Cost is measured as a &quot;marginal cost,&quot; the amount of dollars required to achieve each million metric ton of abatement.</p>\r\n<p>This &quot;<strong>marginal abatement cost curve</strong>&quot; aids the decision-making. It lines up the programs from the most cost-effective to the least cost-effective. The decision-maker is presumed to prefer a more cost-effective program than a less cost-effective program. The chart answers the following question: for any given subset of programs (so long as we select them left to right contiguously), we can read off the cumulative amount of CO2 abated.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>There are still more limitations of the chart design.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We can&#39;t directly read off the cumulative cost of the selected subset of programs because the vertical axis is not cumulative. The cumulative cost turns out to be the <strong>total area</strong> of all the columns that correspond to the selected programs. (Area is height x width, which is cost per benefit multiplied by benefit, which leaves us with the cost.) Unfortunately, it takes rulers and calculators to compute this total area.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>We have presumed that policy-makers will make the Go-No-go decision based on cost effectiveness alone</strong>. This point of view has already been contradicted. Remember the mystery around negatively cost-effective programs - their existence shows that some programs are stalled even when they reduce emissions in addition to making money!<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>Since many, if not most, programs have negative cost-effectiveness (by the way they measured it), I&#39;d flip the metric over and call it profitability (or return on investment). Doing so removes another barrier to our understanding. With the current cost-effectiveness metric, policy-makers are selecting the &quot;negative&quot; programs before the &quot;positive&quot; programs. <strong>It makes more sense to select the &quot;positive&quot; programs before the &quot;negative&quot; ones!</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In a <strong>Trifecta Checkup </strong>(<a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup\">guide</a>), I rate this chart <strong>Type V</strong>. The chart has a great purpose, and the design reveals a keen sense of the decision-making process. It&#39;s not a data dump for sure. In addition, an impressive amount of data gathering and analysis - and synthesis - went into preparing the two data series required to construct the chart. (Sure, for something so subjective and speculative, the analysis methodology will inevitably be challenged by wonks.) Those two data series are reasonable measures for the stated purpose of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>The chart form, though, has various shortcomings, as shown here. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In our email exchange, Antonio and I found the Plan Washington <a href=\"http://planwashington.org/blog/archive/understanding-carbon-reduction-marginal-abatement-cost-curves/\" title=\"Link to Plan Washington\">website</a> useful. This is where we learned that this chart is called the marginal abatement cost curve.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the consulting firm McKinsey is responsible for popularizing this chart form. They have published this long <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/reducing-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions\" title=\"link to Mckinsey\">report</a> that explains even more of the analysis behind constructing this chart, for those who want further details.</p>",

Like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_fueleconomystandardscars\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc051200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_fueleconomystandardscars\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The horror of this design constraint is fully realized in the following chart, a similar design produced for the state of Oregon (lifted from the Plan Washington webpage listed as a resource below):</p>\r\n<p><strong><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Figure 2 oregon greenhouse\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8dc0d200d-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Figure 2 oregon greenhouse\" /></a></strong></p>\r\n<p>In a re-design, horizontal labeling should be a priority.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Realizing that I&#39;ve been distracted by the text labels, back to the horizontal <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/axis\" title=\"posts about axes\">axis</a> I went.</p>\r\n<p>This is where I encountered the next roadblock.</p>\r\n<p>The axis title says &quot;Average Annual Emissions Abatement&quot; measured in millions metric tons. The unit matches the second part of the vertical scale, which is comforting. But how does one reconcile the widths of columns with a continuous scale? I was expecting each program to have a projected annual abatement benefit, and those would fall as dots on a line, like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_dotplot\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ed9cec200b-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_dotplot\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Instead, we have line segments sitting on a line, like this:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_annuallabel\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fb9c9200c-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_annuallabel\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Think of these bars as the bottom edges of the columns. These line segments can be better compared to each other if structured as a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar and column charts\">bar chart</a>:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4c8e758200d-250wi\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Instead, the design arranges these lines end-to-end.</p>\r\n<p>To unravel this mystery, we go back to the objective of the chart, as announced by the book reviewer. Here it is again:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>policy-makers can focus on the areas which make the most difference in emissions, while also being mindful of the cost issues that can be so important in getting political buy-in.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The primary goal of the chart is a <strong>decision-making tool for policy-makers</strong> who are evaluating programs. Each program has a cost and also a benefit. The cost is shown on the vertical axis and the benefit is shown on the horizontal. The decision-maker will select some subset of these programs based on the cost-benefit analysis. That subset of programs will have a projected <em>total</em> expected benefit (CO2 abatement) and a projected total cost.</p>\r\n<p>By stacking the line segments end to end on top of the horizontal axis, the chart designer elevates the task of computing the <em>total</em> benefits of a subset of programs, relative to the task of learning the benefits of any individual program. Thus, the horizontal axis is better labeled &quot;Cumulative annual emissions abatement&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Look at that axis again. Imagine you are required to learn the specific benefit of program titled &quot;Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs&quot;. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_cumlabel\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a49fc03d200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_abatement_benefit_bars_end2end_cumlabel\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This is impossible to do without pulling out a ruler and a calculator. What the axis labels do tell us is that if all the programs to the left of Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs were adopted, the cumulative benefits would be 285 million metric tons of CO2 per year. And if Fuel Economy Standards: Cars &amp; SUVs were also implemented, the cumulative benefits would rise to 375 million metric tons.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>At long last, we have arrived at a reasonable interpretation of the cost-benefit chart.</p>\r\n<p>Policy-makers are considering throwing their support behind specific programs aimed at abating CO2 emissions. Different organizations have come up with different ways to achieve this goal. This goal may even have specific benchmarks; the government may have committed to an international agreement, for example, to reduce emissions by some set amount by 2030. Each candidate abatement program is evaluated on both cost and benefit dimensions. Benefit is given by the amount of CO2 abated. Cost is measured as a &quot;marginal cost,&quot; the amount of dollars required to achieve each million metric ton of abatement.</p>\r\n<p>This &quot;<strong>marginal abatement cost curve</strong>&quot; aids the decision-making. It lines up the programs from the most cost-effective to the least cost-effective. The decision-maker is presumed to prefer a more cost-effective program than a less cost-effective program. The chart answers the following question: for any given subset of programs (so long as we select them left to right contiguously), we can read off the cumulative amount of CO2 abated.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>There are still more limitations of the chart design.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We can&#39;t directly read off the cumulative cost of the selected subset of programs because the vertical axis is not cumulative. The cumulative cost turns out to be the <strong>total area</strong> of all the columns that correspond to the selected programs. (Area is height x width, which is cost per benefit multiplied by benefit, which leaves us with the cost.) Unfortunately, it takes rulers and calculators to compute this total area.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>We have presumed that policy-makers will make the Go-No-go decision based on cost effectiveness alone</strong>. This point of view has already been contradicted. Remember the mystery around negatively cost-effective programs - their existence shows that some programs are stalled even when they reduce emissions in addition to making money!<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li>Since many, if not most, programs have negative cost-effectiveness (by the way they measured it), I&#39;d flip the metric over and call it profitability (or return on investment). Doing so removes another barrier to our understanding. With the current cost-effectiveness metric, policy-makers are selecting the &quot;negative&quot; programs before the &quot;positive&quot; programs. <strong>It makes more sense to select the &quot;positive&quot; programs before the &quot;negative&quot; ones!</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In a <strong>Trifecta Checkup </strong>(<a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Guide to Trifecta Checkup\">guide</a>), I rate this chart <strong>Type V</strong>. The chart has a great purpose, and the design reveals a keen sense of the decision-making process. It&#39;s not a data dump for sure. In addition, an impressive amount of data gathering and analysis - and synthesis - went into preparing the two data series required to construct the chart. (Sure, for something so subjective and speculative, the analysis methodology will inevitably be challenged by wonks.) Those two data series are reasonable measures for the stated purpose of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>The chart form, though, has various shortcomings, as shown here. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In our email exchange, Antonio and I found the Plan Washington <a href=\"http://planwashington.org/blog/archive/understanding-carbon-reduction-marginal-abatement-cost-curves/\" title=\"Link to Plan Washington\">website</a> useful. This is where we learned that this chart is called the marginal abatement cost curve.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the consulting firm McKinsey is responsible for popularizing this chart form. They have published this long <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/reducing-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions\" title=\"link to Mckinsey\">report</a> that explains even more of the analysis behind constructing this chart, for those who want further details.</p>",

They found 23 different definitions. Some media outlets apply different definitions in different items.</p>\r\n<p>I appreciate this effort a lot. The design is thoughtful. In making this chart, the designer added the following guides:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/text\" title=\"Posts about text\">text</a> draws attention to the definition with the shortest range of birth years, and the one with the largest range.</li>\r\n<li>The dashed gray <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/gridlines\" title=\"Posts about gridlines\">gridlines</a> help with reading the endpoints of each bar.</li>\r\n<li>The yellow band illustrates the so-called average range. It appears that this average range is formed by taking the average of the beginning years and the average of the ending years. This indicates a desire to allow <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/comparability\" title=\"Posts about comparisons\">comparisons</a> between each definition and the average range.</li>\r\n<li>The bars are ordered by the ending birth year (right edge).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The underlying issue is <strong>how to display uncertainty</strong>. The interest here is not just to feature the &quot;average&quot; definition of a millennial but to show the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/variance\" title=\"Posts about variance\">range</a> of definitions.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In making my chart, I apply a different way to find the &quot;average&quot; range. Given any year, say 1990, what is the chance that it is included in any of the definitions? In other words, what proportion of the definitions include that year? In the following chart, the darker the color, the more likely that year is included by the &quot;average&quot; opinion.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4e056cf200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_junkcharts_cnbcmillennials\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4e056cf200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4e056cf200b-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_junkcharts_cnbcmillennials\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>I ordered the bars from shortest to the longest so there is no need to annotate them. Based on this analysis, 90 percent (or higher) of the sources list <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">1965</span>1985 to 1993 as part of the range while 70 percent (or higher) list <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">1961</span>1981 to 1996 as part of the range.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

         "renderedContent": "<p>I found this fascinating chart from CNBC, which attempts to nail down the definition of a millennial.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bba80e200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Millennials2-01\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bba80e200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bba80e200d-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Millennials2-01\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>It turns out everyone defines &quot;millennials&quot; differently. They found 23 different definitions. Some media outlets apply different definitions in different items.</p>\r\n<p>I appreciate this effort a lot. The design is thoughtful. In making this chart, the designer added the following guides:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/text\" title=\"Posts about text\">text</a> draws attention to the definition with the shortest range of birth years, and the one with the largest range.</li>\r\n<li>The dashed gray <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/gridlines\" title=\"Posts about gridlines\">gridlines</a> help with reading the endpoints of each bar.</li>\r\n<li>The yellow band illustrates the so-called average range. It appears that this average range is formed by taking the average of the beginning years and the average of the ending years. This indicates a desire to allow <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/comparability\" title=\"Posts about comparisons\">comparisons</a> between each definition and the average range.</li>\r\n<li>The bars are ordered by the ending birth year (right edge).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The underlying issue is <strong>how to display uncertainty</strong>. The interest here is not just to feature the &quot;average&quot; definition of a millennial but to show the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/variance\" title=\"Posts about variance\">range</a> of definitions.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In making my chart, I apply a different way to find the &quot;average&quot; range. Given any year, say 1990, what is the chance that it is included in any of the definitions? In other words, what proportion of the definitions include that year? In the following chart, the darker the color, the more likely that year is included by the &quot;average&quot; opinion.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4e056cf200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_junkcharts_cnbcmillennials\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4e056cf200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4e056cf200b-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_junkcharts_cnbcmillennials\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>I ordered the bars from shortest to the longest so there is no need to annotate them. Based on this analysis, 90 percent (or higher) of the sources list <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">1965</span>1985 to 1993 as part of the range while 70 percent (or higher) list <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">1961</span>1981 to 1996 as part of the range.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

This <strong>heatmap</strong> showing gene expressions show one column per patient:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fdf200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Jnci_genemap\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fdf200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fdf200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Jnci_genemap\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This so-called <strong>swimmer plot</strong> shows one bar per patient:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a88b65200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Jnci_swimlanes\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a88b65200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a88b65200d-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Jnci_swimlanes\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This <strong>spider plot</strong> shows the progression of individual patients over time. Key events are marked with symbols.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fcd200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Jnci_spaghetti\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fcd200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fcd200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Jnci_spaghetti\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>These chart forms are distinguished from other ones that plot aggregated statistics: statistical averages, medians, subgroup averages, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>One obvious limitation of such charts is their lack of scalability. The number of patients, the variability of the metric, and the timing of trends all drive up the amount of messiness.</p>\r\n<p>I am left wondering what <strong>Question</strong> is being addressed by these plots. If we are concerned about treatment of an individual patient, then showing each line by itself would be clearer. If we are interested in the average trends of patients, then a chart that plots the overall average, or subgroup averages would be more accurate. If the interpretation of the individual&#39;s trend requires comparing with similar patients, then showing that individual&#39;s line against the subgroup average would be preferred.</p>\r\n<p>When shown these charts of individual lines, readers are tempted to <strong>play the statistician - without using appropriate tools!</strong> Readers draw aggregate conclusions, performing the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/aggregation\" title=\"Posts about aggregation\">aggregation</a> in their heads.</p>\r\n<p>The authors of the paper note: &quot;Spider plots only provide good visual qualitative assessment but do not allow for formal statistical inference.&quot; I agree with the second part. The first part is a fallacy - if the visual qualitative assessment is good enough, then no formal inference is necessary! The same argument is often made when people say they don&#39;t need advanced analysis because their simple analysis is &quot;directionally accurate&quot;. When is something &quot;directionally inaccurate&quot;? How would one know?</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>Reference</em>: Chia, Gedye, et. al., &quot;</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Current and Evolving Methods to Visualize Biological Data in Cancer Research&quot;, JNCI, 2016, 108(8).

The cone map, as we discussed, shows the range of probable paths of the storm center, based on all simulations of all acceptable models for projection. The spaghetti map shows selected individual simulations. Each line is the most likely trajectory of the storm center as predicted by a single simulation from a single model.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that each predictive model type has its own historical accuracy (known as &quot;skill&quot;), and so the lines embody different levels of importance. Further, it&#39;s not immediately clear if all possible lines are drawn so any reader making conclusions of, say, the envelope containing x percent of these lines is likely to be fooled. Eyeballing the &quot;cone&quot; that contains x percent of the lines is not trivial either. We tend to naturally drift toward aggregate statistical conclusions without the benefit of appropriate tools.</p>\r\n<p>Plots of individuals should be used to address the specific problem of assessing individuals.</p>",

This <strong>heatmap</strong> showing gene expressions show one column per patient:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fdf200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Jnci_genemap\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fdf200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fdf200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Jnci_genemap\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This so-called <strong>swimmer plot</strong> shows one bar per patient:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a88b65200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Jnci_swimlanes\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a88b65200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a88b65200d-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Jnci_swimlanes\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This <strong>spider plot</strong> shows the progression of individual patients over time. Key events are marked with symbols.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fcd200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Jnci_spaghetti\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fcd200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47f4fcd200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Jnci_spaghetti\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>These chart forms are distinguished from other ones that plot aggregated statistics: statistical averages, medians, subgroup averages, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>One obvious limitation of such charts is their lack of scalability. The number of patients, the variability of the metric, and the timing of trends all drive up the amount of messiness.</p>\r\n<p>I am left wondering what <strong>Question</strong> is being addressed by these plots. If we are concerned about treatment of an individual patient, then showing each line by itself would be clearer. If we are interested in the average trends of patients, then a chart that plots the overall average, or subgroup averages would be more accurate. If the interpretation of the individual&#39;s trend requires comparing with similar patients, then showing that individual&#39;s line against the subgroup average would be preferred.</p>\r\n<p>When shown these charts of individual lines, readers are tempted to <strong>play the statistician - without using appropriate tools!</strong> Readers draw aggregate conclusions, performing the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/aggregation\" title=\"Posts about aggregation\">aggregation</a> in their heads.</p>\r\n<p>The authors of the paper note: &quot;Spider plots only provide good visual qualitative assessment but do not allow for formal statistical inference.&quot; I agree with the second part. The first part is a fallacy - if the visual qualitative assessment is good enough, then no formal inference is necessary! The same argument is often made when people say they don&#39;t need advanced analysis because their simple analysis is &quot;directionally accurate&quot;. When is something &quot;directionally inaccurate&quot;? How would one know?</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>Reference</em>: Chia, Gedye, et. al., &quot;</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: georgia, palatino; color: #111111;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Current and Evolving Methods to Visualize Biological Data in Cancer Research&quot;, JNCI, 2016, 108(8).

The cone map, as we discussed, shows the range of probable paths of the storm center, based on all simulations of all acceptable models for projection. The spaghetti map shows selected individual simulations. Each line is the most likely trajectory of the storm center as predicted by a single simulation from a single model.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that each predictive model type has its own historical accuracy (known as &quot;skill&quot;), and so the lines embody different levels of importance. Further, it&#39;s not immediately clear if all possible lines are drawn so any reader making conclusions of, say, the envelope containing x percent of these lines is likely to be fooled. Eyeballing the &quot;cone&quot; that contains x percent of the lines is not trivial either. We tend to naturally drift toward aggregate statistical conclusions without the benefit of appropriate tools.</p>\r\n<p>Plots of individuals should be used to address the specific problem of assessing individuals.</p>",

         "content": "<p>As Hurricane Dorian threatens the southeastern coast of the U.S., forecasters are fretting about the lack of consensus among various predictive models used to predict the storm’s trajectory. The uncertainty of these models, as reflected in graphical displays, has been a controversial issue in the visualization community for some time.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s start by reviewing a visual design that has captured meteorologists in recent years, something known as the <strong>cone map</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc518c200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Charley_oldconemap\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc518c200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc518c200b-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Charley_oldconemap\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>If asked to explain this <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/map\" title=\"Posts about maps\">map</a>, most of us trace a line through the middle of the cone understood to be the center of the storm, the “cone” as the areas near the storm center that are affected, and the warmer colors (red, orange) as indicating higher levels of impact. [Note: We will&#0160; design for this type of map circa 2000s.]</p>\r\n<p>The above interpretation is complete, and feasible. Nevertheless, the data used to make the map are forward-looking, not historical. It is still possible to stick to the same interpretation by substituting historical measurement of impact with its projection. As such, the “warmer” regions are projected to suffer worse damage from the storm than the “cooler” regions (yellow).</p>\r\n<p>After I replace the text that was removed from the map (see below), you may notice the color <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/legend\" title=\"Posts about legend\">legend</a>, which discloses that the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/color\" title=\"Posts about colors\">colors</a> on the map encode probabilities, not storm intensity. The text further explains that the chart shows the most probable path of the <em>center</em> of the storm – while the coloring shows the probability that the storm center will reach specific areas.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc51c6200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Charley_oldconemap\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc51c6200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc51c6200b-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Charley_oldconemap\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>When reading a data graphic, we rarely first look for text about how to read the chart. In the case of the cone map, those who didn’t seek out the instructions may form one of these misunderstandings:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>For someone living in the yellow-shaded areas, the map does not say that the impact of the storm is projected to be lighter; it’s that the center of the storm has a lower chance of passing right through. If, however, the storm does pay a visit, the intensity of the winds will reach hurricane grade.</li>\r\n<li>For someone living outside the cone, the map does not say that the storm will definitely bypass you; it’s that the chance of a direct hit is below the threshold needed to show up on the cone map.

         "renderedContent": "<p>As Hurricane Dorian threatens the southeastern coast of the U.S., forecasters are fretting about the lack of consensus among various predictive models used to predict the storm’s trajectory. The uncertainty of these models, as reflected in graphical displays, has been a controversial issue in the visualization community for some time.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s start by reviewing a visual design that has captured meteorologists in recent years, something known as the <strong>cone map</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc518c200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Charley_oldconemap\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc518c200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc518c200b-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Charley_oldconemap\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>If asked to explain this <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/map\" title=\"Posts about maps\">map</a>, most of us trace a line through the middle of the cone understood to be the center of the storm, the “cone” as the areas near the storm center that are affected, and the warmer colors (red, orange) as indicating higher levels of impact. [Note: We will&#0160; design for this type of map circa 2000s.]</p>\r\n<p>The above interpretation is complete, and feasible. Nevertheless, the data used to make the map are forward-looking, not historical. It is still possible to stick to the same interpretation by substituting historical measurement of impact with its projection. As such, the “warmer” regions are projected to suffer worse damage from the storm than the “cooler” regions (yellow).</p>\r\n<p>After I replace the text that was removed from the map (see below), you may notice the color <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/legend\" title=\"Posts about legend\">legend</a>, which discloses that the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/color\" title=\"Posts about colors\">colors</a> on the map encode probabilities, not storm intensity. The text further explains that the chart shows the most probable path of the <em>center</em> of the storm – while the coloring shows the probability that the storm center will reach specific areas.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc51c6200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Charley_oldconemap\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc51c6200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4cc51c6200b-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Charley_oldconemap\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>When reading a data graphic, we rarely first look for text about how to read the chart. In the case of the cone map, those who didn’t seek out the instructions may form one of these misunderstandings:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>For someone living in the yellow-shaded areas, the map does not say that the impact of the storm is projected to be lighter; it’s that the center of the storm has a lower chance of passing right through. If, however, the storm does pay a visit, the intensity of the winds will reach hurricane grade.</li>\r\n<li>For someone living outside the cone, the map does not say that the storm will definitely bypass you; it’s that the chance of a direct hit is below the threshold needed to show up on the cone map. Thee threshold is set to attain 66% accurate. The actual paths of storms are expected to stay inside the cone two out of three times.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Adding to the confusion, other designers have produced cone maps in which color is encoding projections of wind speeds. Here is the one for Dorian.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47e6d61200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"AL052019_wind_probs_64_F120\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47e6d61200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a47e6d61200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"AL052019_wind_probs_64_F120\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This map displays essentially what we thought the first cone map was showing.</p>\r\n<p>One way to differentiate the two maps is to roll time forward, and imagine what the maps should look like after the storm has passed through.

         "content": "<p>Via Alberto <a href=\"https://thefunctionart.com\">Cairo</a> (whose new <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2019/03/book-preview-how-charts-lie-by-alberto-cairo.html\" title=\"Link to Alberto Cairo book review\">book</a> <em>How Charts Lie</em> can be <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Fi8PRx\" title=\"Link to Alberto Cairo new book page\">pre-ordered</a>!), I found the Water Stress data visualization by the Washington Post. (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/08/06/mapping-strain-our-water/\" title=\"Link to Washington Post\">link</a>)</p>\r\n<p>The main interest here is how they visualized the different levels of water stress across the U.S. Water stress is some metric defined by the Water Resources Institute that, to my mind, measures the demand versus supply of water. The higher the water stress, the higher the risk of experiencing droughts.</p>\r\n<p>There are two ways in which the water stress data are shown: the first is a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/map\" title=\"Posts about maps\">map</a>, and the second is a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bubble_plot\" title=\"Posts about bubble plots\">bubble plot</a>.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a5c38d200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Wp_waterstress\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a5c38d200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a5c38d200d-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Wp_waterstress\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This project provides a great setting to compare and contrast these chart forms.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Data are Coded</strong></p>\r\n<p>In a map, the data are usually coded as <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/color\" title=\"Posts about color\">colors</a>. Sometimes, additional details can be coded as shades, or moire patterns within the colors. But the map form locks down a number of useful dimensions - including x and y location, size and shape. The outline map reserves all these dimensions, rendering them unavailable to encode data.</p>\r\n<p>By contrast, the bubble plot admits a good number of dimensions. The key ones are the x- and y- location. Then, you can also encode data in the size of the dots, the shape, and the color of the dots.</p>\r\n<p>In our map example, the colors encode the water stress level, and a moire pattern encodes &quot;arid areas&quot;. For the scatter plot, x = daily water use, y = water stress level, grouped by magnitude, color = water stress level, size = population. (Shape is constant.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spatial Correlation</strong></p>\r\n<p>The map is far superior in displaying spatial correlation. It&#39;s visually obvious that the southwestern states experience higher stress levels.</p>\r\n<p>This spatial knowledge is relinquished when using a bubble plot. The designer relies on the knowledge of the U.S. map in the head of the readers. It is possible to code this into one of the available dimensions, e.g. one could make x = U.S. regions, but another variable is sacrificed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Non-contiguous Spatial Patterns</strong></p>\r\n<p>When spatial patterns are contiguous, the map functions well. Sometimes, spatial patterns are disjoint. In that case, the bubble plot, which de-emphasizes the physcial locations, can be superior. In our example, the vertical axis divides the states into five groups based on their water stress levels.

         "renderedContent": "<p>Via Alberto <a href=\"https://thefunctionart.com\">Cairo</a> (whose new <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2019/03/book-preview-how-charts-lie-by-alberto-cairo.html\" title=\"Link to Alberto Cairo book review\">book</a> <em>How Charts Lie</em> can be <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Fi8PRx\" title=\"Link to Alberto Cairo new book page\">pre-ordered</a>!), I found the Water Stress data visualization by the Washington Post. (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/08/06/mapping-strain-our-water/\" title=\"Link to Washington Post\">link</a>)</p>\r\n<p>The main interest here is how they visualized the different levels of water stress across the U.S. Water stress is some metric defined by the Water Resources Institute that, to my mind, measures the demand versus supply of water. The higher the water stress, the higher the risk of experiencing droughts.</p>\r\n<p>There are two ways in which the water stress data are shown: the first is a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/map\" title=\"Posts about maps\">map</a>, and the second is a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bubble_plot\" title=\"Posts about bubble plots\">bubble plot</a>.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a5c38d200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Wp_waterstress\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a5c38d200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a5c38d200d-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Wp_waterstress\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This project provides a great setting to compare and contrast these chart forms.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Data are Coded</strong></p>\r\n<p>In a map, the data are usually coded as <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/color\" title=\"Posts about color\">colors</a>. Sometimes, additional details can be coded as shades, or moire patterns within the colors. But the map form locks down a number of useful dimensions - including x and y location, size and shape. The outline map reserves all these dimensions, rendering them unavailable to encode data.</p>\r\n<p>By contrast, the bubble plot admits a good number of dimensions. The key ones are the x- and y- location. Then, you can also encode data in the size of the dots, the shape, and the color of the dots.</p>\r\n<p>In our map example, the colors encode the water stress level, and a moire pattern encodes &quot;arid areas&quot;. For the scatter plot, x = daily water use, y = water stress level, grouped by magnitude, color = water stress level, size = population. (Shape is constant.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spatial Correlation</strong></p>\r\n<p>The map is far superior in displaying spatial correlation. It&#39;s visually obvious that the southwestern states experience higher stress levels.</p>\r\n<p>This spatial knowledge is relinquished when using a bubble plot. The designer relies on the knowledge of the U.S. map in the head of the readers. It is possible to code this into one of the available dimensions, e.g. one could make x = U.S. regions, but another variable is sacrificed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Non-contiguous Spatial Patterns</strong></p>\r\n<p>When spatial patterns are contiguous, the map functions well. Sometimes, spatial patterns are disjoint. In that case, the bubble plot, which de-emphasizes the physcial locations, can be superior. In our example, the vertical axis divides the states into five groups based on their water stress levels. Try figuring out which states are &quot;medium to high&quot; water stress from the map, and you&#39;ll see the difference.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Finer Geographies</strong></p>\r\n<p>The map handles finer geographical units like counties and precincts better. It&#39;s completely natural.</p>\r\n<p>In the bubble plot, shifting to finer units causes the number of dots to explode. This clutters up the chart. Besides, while most (we hope) Americans know the 50 states, most of us can&#39;t recite counties or precincts. Thus, the designer can&#39;t rely on knowledge in our heads. It would be impossible to learn spatial patterns from such a chart.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The key, as always, is to nail down your message, then select the right chart form.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

         "content": "<p>In the recent <a href=\"https://datajournalism.com/read/newsletters/bad-charts\" title=\"Link to DataJournalism\">issue</a> of Madolyn Smith’s Conversations with Data newsletter hosted by <a href=\"https://datajournalism.com\">DataJournalism.com</a>, she discusses “bad charts,” featuring submissions from several dataviz bloggers, including myself.</p>\r\n<p>What is a “bad chart”? Based on this <a href=\"https://datajournalism.com/read/newsletters/bad-charts\" title=\"Link to newsletter\">collection</a> of curated &quot;bad charts&quot;, it is not easy to nail down “bad-ness”. The common theme is the <strong>mismatch between the message intended by the designer and the message received by the reader, a classic error of communication</strong>. How such mismatch arises depends on the specific example. I am able to divide the “bad charts” into two groups: charts that are misinterpreted, and charts that are misleading.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Charts that are misinterpreted</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Causes of Death entry, submitted by <a href=\"http://www.thefunctionalart.com/\" title=\"Link to Alberto Cairo\">Alberto Cairo</a>, is a “well-designed” chart that requires “reading the story where it is inserted and the numerous caveats.” So readers may <strong>misinterpret</strong> the chart if they do not also partake the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from\" title=\"Link to Our World in Data\">story</a> at Our World in Data which runs over 1,500 words not including the appendix.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6bc200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Ourworldindata_causesofdeath\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6bc200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6bc200b-300wi\" style=\"width: 300px;\" title=\"Ourworldindata_causesofdeath\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The map of Canada, submitted by Highsoft, highlights in green the provinces where the majority of residents are members of the First Nations.

Based on this <a href=\"https://datajournalism.com/read/newsletters/bad-charts\" title=\"Link to newsletter\">collection</a> of curated &quot;bad charts&quot;, it is not easy to nail down “bad-ness”. The common theme is the <strong>mismatch between the message intended by the designer and the message received by the reader, a classic error of communication</strong>. How such mismatch arises depends on the specific example. I am able to divide the “bad charts” into two groups: charts that are misinterpreted, and charts that are misleading.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Charts that are misinterpreted</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Causes of Death entry, submitted by <a href=\"http://www.thefunctionalart.com/\" title=\"Link to Alberto Cairo\">Alberto Cairo</a>, is a “well-designed” chart that requires “reading the story where it is inserted and the numerous caveats.” So readers may <strong>misinterpret</strong> the chart if they do not also partake the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from\" title=\"Link to Our World in Data\">story</a> at Our World in Data which runs over 1,500 words not including the appendix.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6bc200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Ourworldindata_causesofdeath\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6bc200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6bc200b-300wi\" style=\"width: 300px;\" title=\"Ourworldindata_causesofdeath\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The map of Canada, submitted by Highsoft, highlights in green the provinces where the majority of residents are members of the First Nations. The “bad” is that readers may incorrectly “infer that a sizable part of the Canadian population is First Nations.”</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6c3200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Highsoft_CanadaFirstNations\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6c3200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bde6c3200b-300wi\" style=\"width: 300px;\" title=\"Highsoft_CanadaFirstNations\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>In these two examples, the graphic is considered adequate and yet the reader fails to glean the message intended by the designer.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Charts that are misleading</strong></p>\r\n<p>Two fellow bloggers, <a href=\"https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/\" title=\"Link to Storytelling with Data\">Cole Knaflic</a> and <a href=\"https://policyviz.com/\">Jon Schwabish,</a> offer the advice to start bars at zero (here&#39;s my <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2014/04/when-to-use-the-start-at-zero-rule-.html\" title=\"Link to prior post\">take</a> on this rule).

         "content": "<p>In the past month, there have been several large-scale protests in Hong Kong. The largest one featured up to two million residents taking to the streets on June 16 to oppose an extradition act that was working its way through the legislature. If the count was accurate, about 25 percent of the city’s population joined in the protest. Another large demonstration occurred on July 1, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://scmp.com\" title=\"Link to South China Morning Post\">South China Morning Post</a>, which can be considered the New York Times of Hong Kong, is well known for its award-winning <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/scmpgraphics\" title=\"Link to Twitter\">infographics</a>, and they rose to the occasion with this <a href=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3016815/hong-kong-protest-city/index.html\" title=\"Link to SCMP\">effort</a>.</p>\r\n<p>This is one of the rare infographics that you’d not regret spending time reading. After reading it, you have learned a few new things about protesting in Hong Kong.</p>\r\n<p>In particular, you’ll learn that the recent demonstrations are part of a larger pattern in which Hong Kong residents express their dissatisfaction with the city’s governing class, frequently accused of acting as puppets of the Chinese state. Under the “one country, two systems” arrangement, the city’s officials occupy an unenviable position of mediating the various contradictions of the two systems.</p>\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">bar chart</a> shows the growth in the protest movement. The recent massive protests didn&#39;t come out of nowhere.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4981027200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Scmp_protestsovertime\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4981027200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4981027200d-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Scmp_protestsovertime\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/line_chart\" title=\"Posts about line charts\">line chart</a> offers a possible explanation for burgeoning protests.

Umbrellas are used to block pepper sprays, for example. The following lovely graphic shows how the costumes have evolved:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bcad82200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Scmp_protestcostume\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bcad82200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bcad82200b-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Scmp_protestcostume\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The scale of these protests captures the imagination. The last part in the infographic places the number of protestors in context, by expressing it in terms of football pitches (as soccer fields are known outside the U.S.) This is a sort of universal measure due to the popularity of football almost everywhere. (Nevertheless, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch\" title=\"Link to wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a>, the fields do not have one fixed dimension even though fields used for international matches are standardized to 105 m by 68 m.)</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2c4200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Scmp_protestscale_pitches\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2c4200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2c4200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Scmp_protestscale_pitches\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This chart could be presented as a bar chart.

         "renderedContent": "<p>In the past month, there have been several large-scale protests in Hong Kong. The largest one featured up to two million residents taking to the streets on June 16 to oppose an extradition act that was working its way through the legislature. If the count was accurate, about 25 percent of the city’s population joined in the protest. Another large demonstration occurred on July 1, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://scmp.com\" title=\"Link to South China Morning Post\">South China Morning Post</a>, which can be considered the New York Times of Hong Kong, is well known for its award-winning <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/scmpgraphics\" title=\"Link to Twitter\">infographics</a>, and they rose to the occasion with this <a href=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3016815/hong-kong-protest-city/index.html\" title=\"Link to SCMP\">effort</a>.</p>\r\n<p>This is one of the rare infographics that you’d not regret spending time reading. After reading it, you have learned a few new things about protesting in Hong Kong.</p>\r\n<p>In particular, you’ll learn that the recent demonstrations are part of a larger pattern in which Hong Kong residents express their dissatisfaction with the city’s governing class, frequently accused of acting as puppets of the Chinese state. Under the “one country, two systems” arrangement, the city’s officials occupy an unenviable position of mediating the various contradictions of the two systems.</p>\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">bar chart</a> shows the growth in the protest movement. The recent massive protests didn&#39;t come out of nowhere.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4981027200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Scmp_protestsovertime\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4981027200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4981027200d-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Scmp_protestsovertime\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/line_chart\" title=\"Posts about line charts\">line chart</a> offers a possible explanation for burgeoning protests. Residents’ perceived their freedoms eroding in the last decade.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2a5200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Scmp_freedomsurvey\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2a5200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2a5200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Scmp_freedomsurvey\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>If you have seen videos of the protests, you’ll have noticed the peculiar protest costumes. Umbrellas are used to block pepper sprays, for example. The following lovely graphic shows how the costumes have evolved:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bcad82200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Scmp_protestcostume\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bcad82200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4bcad82200b-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Scmp_protestcostume\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The scale of these protests captures the imagination. The last part in the infographic places the number of protestors in context, by expressing it in terms of football pitches (as soccer fields are known outside the U.S.) This is a sort of universal measure due to the popularity of football almost everywhere. (Nevertheless, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch\" title=\"Link to wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a>, the fields do not have one fixed dimension even though fields used for international matches are standardized to 105 m by 68 m.)</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2c4200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Scmp_protestscale_pitches\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2c4200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ed2c4200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Scmp_protestscale_pitches\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This chart could be presented as a bar chart. It’s just that the data have been re-<a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/scale\" title=\"Posts about scale\">scaled</a> – from counting individuals to counting football pitches-ful of individuals.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>***<br /><a href=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3016815/hong-kong-protest-city/index.html\" title=\"Link to South China Morning Post\">Here</a> is the entire infographics.</p>",

         "content": "<p>The editors of ASA&#39;s <em>Amstat News</em> certainly got my attention, in a recent <a href=\"https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/06/01/school-counselors/\" title=\"Link to Amstat News\">article</a> on school counselling. A research team asked two questions. The first was HOW ARE YOU FELINE?</p>\r\n<p>Stats and cats. The pun got my attention and presumably also made others stop and wonder. The second question was HOW DO YOU REMEMBER FEELING while you were taking a college statistics course? Well, it&#39;s hard to imagine the average response to that question would be positive.</p>\r\n<p>What also drew me to the <a href=\"https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/06/01/school-counselors/\" title=\"Link to Amstat News\">article</a> was this pair of charts:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ba1deb200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Counselors_Figure1small\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ba1deb200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ba1deb200b-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Counselors_Figure1small\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Surely, ASA can do better. (I&#39;m happy to volunteer my time!)</p>\r\n<p>Rotate the chart, clean up the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/color\" title=\"Posts about color\">colors</a>, remove the decimals, put the chart titles up top, etc.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The above remedies fall into the V corner of my <a href=\"https://bitly.com/trifectacheckup\" title=\"Posts about Trifecta Checkup\">Trifecta</a> checkup.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46c472b200c-pi\" style=\"float: right;\"><img alt=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46c472b200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46c472b200c-300wi\" style=\"width: 300px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;\" title=\"Trifectacheckup_junkcharts_image\" /></a>The key to fixing this chart is to <strong>tighten the bond between the message and the visual</strong>. This means working that <em>green link</em> between the Q and V corners.</p>\r\n<p>This much became clear after reading the article. The following paragraphs are central to the research (<span style=\"font-family: helvetica;\"><strong>bolding</strong></span> is mine):</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\r\n<div class=\"section\" style=\"background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);\">\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Responses indicated the majority of school counselors <strong>recalled experiences</strong> of studying statistics in college that they described with words associated with more <strong>unpleasant affect</strong> (i.e., alarm, anger, distress, fear, misery, gloom, depression, sadness, and tiredness; </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;\">n </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">= 93; 66%). By contrast, a majority of counselors reported same-day (i.e., <strong>current) emotions</strong> that appeared to be associated with more <strong>pleasant affect</strong> (i.e., pleasure, happiness, excitement, astonishment, sleepiness, satisfaction, and calm; </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;\">n </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">= 123; 88%). </span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>Both recalled emotive experiences and current emotional states appeared approximately</strong> <strong>balanced on dimensions of arousal</strong>: recalled experiences associated with lower arousal (i.e., pleasure, misery, gloom, depression, sadness, tiredness, sleepiness, satisfaction, and calm, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;\">n </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">= 65, 46%); recalled experiences associated with higher arousal (i.e., happiness, excitement, astonishment, alarm, anger, distress, fear, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;\">n </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">= 70, 50%); current emotions associated with lower arousal (</span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;\">n </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">= 60, 43%); current experiences associated with higher arousal (i.e., </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;\">n </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: &#39;Times&#39;;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica;\">= 79, 56%).</span> </span></p>\r\n<p>These paragraphs convey two crucial pieces of information: the structure of the analysis, and its insights.</p>\r\n<p>The two survey questions measure two states of experiences, described as <span style=\"font-family: helvetica;\"><strong>current</strong></span> versus <span style=\"font-family: helvetica;\"><strong>recalled</strong></span>. Then the individual affects (of which there were 16 plus an option of &quot;other&quot;) are scored on two dimensions, pleasure and arousal.

A research team asked two questions. The first was HOW ARE YOU FELINE?</p>\r\n<p>Stats and cats. The pun got my attention and presumably also made others stop and wonder. The second question was HOW DO YOU REMEMBER FEELING while you were taking a college statistics course? Well, it&#39;s hard to imagine the average response to that question would be positive.</p>\r\n<p>What also drew me to the <a href=\"https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/06/01/school-counselors/\" title=\"Link to Amstat News\">article</a> was this pair of charts:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ba1deb200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Counselors_Figure1small\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ba1deb200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4ba1deb200b-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Counselors_Figure1small\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Surely, ASA can do better.

For someone with a decent background in statistics (and grasp of basic baseball jargon), it’s a book that can be consumed within one week, after which one receives a good overview of baseball analytics, otherwise known as sabermetrics.</p>\r\n<p>Within fewer than 200 pages, Albert outlines approaches to a variety of problems, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comparing baseball players by key hitting (or pitching) metrics</li>\r\n<li>Tracking a player’s career</li>\r\n<li>Estimating the value of different plays, such as a single, a triple or a walk</li>\r\n<li>Predicting expected runs in an inning from the current state of play</li>\r\n<li>Analyzing pitches and swings using PitchFX data</li>\r\n<li>Describing the effect of ballparks on home runs</li>\r\n<li>Estimating the effect of particular plays on the outcome of a game</li>\r\n<li>Simulating “fake” games and seasons in order to produce probabilistic forecasts such as X% chance that team Y will win the World Series</li>\r\n<li>Examining whether a hitter is “streaky” or not</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Most of the analyses are descriptive in nature, e.g. describing the number and types of pitches thrown by a particular pitcher, or the change in on-base percentage over the career of a particular hitter. A lesser number of pages are devoted to predictive analytics. This structure is acceptable in a short introductory book. In practice, decision-makers require more sophisticated work on top of these descriptive analyses. For example, what’s the value of telling a coach that the home run was the pivotal moment in a 1-0 game that has played out?</p>\r\n<p>To appreciate the practical implications of the analyses included in this volume, I’d recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393324818/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=numrulyouwor-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0393324818&amp;linkId=13b6dba56d6c6ed2555275fccadd6803\" title=\"Link to Amazon\"><em>Moneyball</em></a> by Michael Lewis, or the more recent <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525576649/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=numrulyouwor-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0525576649&amp;linkId=524081f327cf186cd0c9d0ff58db9ee0\" title=\"Link to Amazon\"><em>Astroball</em></a> by Ben Reiter.</p>\r\n<p>For the more serious student of sabermetrics, key omitted details will need to be gleaned from other sources, including other books by the same author – for years, I have recommended <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038700193X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=numrulyouwor-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=038700193X&amp;linkId=6abe93c903ebae6645a4b5711b96676f\" title=\"Link to Curve Ball\"><em>Curve Ball</em></a> by Albert and Bennett to my students.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In the final chapters, Albert introduced the simulation of “fake” seasons that underlies predictions. An inquiring reader should investigate how the process is tied back to the reality of what actually happened; otherwise, the simulation will have a life of its own. Further, if one simulates 1,000 seasons of 2018 baseball, a large number of these fake seasons would crown some team other than the Red Sox as the 2018 World Series winner. Think about it: that’s how it is possible to make the prediction that the Red Sox has a say 60 percent chance of winning the World Series in 2018! <strong>A key to understanding the statistical way of thinking is to accept the logic of this fake simulated world</strong>. It is not the stated goal of Albert to convince readers of the statistical way of thinking – but you’re not going to be convinced unless you think about why we do it this way.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>While there are plenty of charts included in the book, a more appropriate title for “Visualizing Baseball” would have been “Fast Intro to Baseball Analytics”. With several exceptions, the charts are not essential to understanding the analyses. The dominant form of exposition is first describe the analytical conclusion, then introduce a chart to illustrate that conclusion. The inverse would be: Start with the chart, and use the chart to explain the analysis.</p>\r\n<p>The visualizations are generally of good quality, emphasizing clarity over prettiness. The choice of sticking to one software, ggplot2 in R, without post-production, constrains the visual designer to the preferences of the software designer. Such limitations are evident in chart elements like legends and titles. Here is one example (Chapter 5, Figure 5.8):</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ac30d200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Albert_visualizingbaseball_chart\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ac30d200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ac30d200c-300wi\" style=\"width: 300px;\" title=\"Albert_visualizingbaseball_chart\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>By default, the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/software\" title=\"Posts about software\">software</a> prints the names of data columns in the titles. Imagine if the plot titles were Changeup, Fastball and Slider instead of CU, FF and SL. Or that the axis labels were “horizontal location” and “vertical location” (check) instead of px and pz. [Note: The chart above was taken from the book&#39;s github site; in the&#0160; Figure 5.8 in the printed book, the chart titles were edited as suggested.]</p>\r\n<p>The chart analyzes the location relative to the strike zone of pitches that were missed versus pitches that were hit (not missed). By default, the software takes the name of the binary variable (“Miss”) as the legend title, and lists the values of the variable (“True” and “False”) as the labels of the two colors. Imagine if True appeared as “Miss” and False as “Hit” .</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the chart exhibits over-plotting, making it tough to know how many blue or gray dots are present. Smaller dot size might help, or else some form of aggregation.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1498782752/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=numrulyouwor-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1498782752&amp;linkId=04a3a34f6c08420de8224769e406bfb8\" title=\"Link to Visualizing Baseball\"><em>Visualizing Baseball</em> </a>is not the book for readers who learn by running code as no code is included in the book. A github page by the author hosts the code, but only the R/ggplot2 code for generating the data visualization. Each script begins <em>after</em> the analysis or modeling has been completed. If you already know R and ggplot2, the github is worth a visit. In any case, I don’t recommend learning coding from copying and pasting clean code.</p>\r\n<p>All in all, I can recommend this short book to any <strong>baseball enthusiast who’s beginning to look at baseball data</strong>. It may expand your appreciation of what can be done. For details, and practical implications, look elsewhere.</p>",

For someone with a decent background in statistics (and grasp of basic baseball jargon), it’s a book that can be consumed within one week, after which one receives a good overview of baseball analytics, otherwise known as sabermetrics.</p>\r\n<p>Within fewer than 200 pages, Albert outlines approaches to a variety of problems, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comparing baseball players by key hitting (or pitching) metrics</li>\r\n<li>Tracking a player’s career</li>\r\n<li>Estimating the value of different plays, such as a single, a triple or a walk</li>\r\n<li>Predicting expected runs in an inning from the current state of play</li>\r\n<li>Analyzing pitches and swings using PitchFX data</li>\r\n<li>Describing the effect of ballparks on home runs</li>\r\n<li>Estimating the effect of particular plays on the outcome of a game</li>\r\n<li>Simulating “fake” games and seasons in order to produce probabilistic forecasts such as X% chance that team Y will win the World Series</li>\r\n<li>Examining whether a hitter is “streaky” or not</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Most of the analyses are descriptive in nature, e.g. describing the number and types of pitches thrown by a particular pitcher, or the change in on-base percentage over the career of a particular hitter. A lesser number of pages are devoted to predictive analytics. This structure is acceptable in a short introductory book. In practice, decision-makers require more sophisticated work on top of these descriptive analyses. For example, what’s the value of telling a coach that the home run was the pivotal moment in a 1-0 game that has played out?</p>\r\n<p>To appreciate the practical implications of the analyses included in this volume, I’d recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393324818/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=numrulyouwor-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0393324818&amp;linkId=13b6dba56d6c6ed2555275fccadd6803\" title=\"Link to Amazon\"><em>Moneyball</em></a> by Michael Lewis, or the more recent <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525576649/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=numrulyouwor-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0525576649&amp;linkId=524081f327cf186cd0c9d0ff58db9ee0\" title=\"Link to Amazon\"><em>Astroball</em></a> by Ben Reiter.</p>\r\n<p>For the more serious student of sabermetrics, key omitted details will need to be gleaned from other sources, including other books by the same author – for years, I have recommended <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038700193X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=numrulyouwor-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=038700193X&amp;linkId=6abe93c903ebae6645a4b5711b96676f\" title=\"Link to Curve Ball\"><em>Curve Ball</em></a> by Albert and Bennett to my students.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In the final chapters, Albert introduced the simulation of “fake” seasons that underlies predictions. An inquiring reader should investigate how the process is tied back to the reality of what actually happened; otherwise, the simulation will have a life of its own. Further, if one simulates 1,000 seasons of 2018 baseball, a large number of these fake seasons would crown some team other than the Red Sox as the 2018 World Series winner. Think about it: that’s how it is possible to make the prediction that the Red Sox has a say 60 percent chance of winning the World Series in 2018! <strong>A key to understanding the statistical way of thinking is to accept the logic of this fake simulated world</strong>. It is not the stated goal of Albert to convince readers of the statistical way of thinking – but you’re not going to be convinced unless you think about why we do it this way.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>While there are plenty of charts included in the book, a more appropriate title for “Visualizing Baseball” would have been “Fast Intro to Baseball Analytics”. With several exceptions, the charts are not essential to understanding the analyses. The dominant form of exposition is first describe the analytical conclusion, then introduce a chart to illustrate that conclusion. The inverse would be: Start with the chart, and use the chart to explain the analysis.</p>\r\n<p>The visualizations are generally of good quality, emphasizing clarity over prettiness. The choice of sticking to one software, ggplot2 in R, without post-production, constrains the visual designer to the preferences of the software designer. Such limitations are evident in chart elements like legends and titles. Here is one example (Chapter 5, Figure 5.8):</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ac30d200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Albert_visualizingbaseball_chart\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ac30d200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a46ac30d200c-300wi\" style=\"width: 300px;\" title=\"Albert_visualizingbaseball_chart\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>By default, the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/software\" title=\"Posts about software\">software</a> prints the names of data columns in the titles. Imagine if the plot titles were Changeup, Fastball and Slider instead of CU, FF and SL. Or that the axis labels were “horizontal location” and “vertical location” (check) instead of px and pz. [Note: The chart above was taken from the book&#39;s github site; in the&#0160; Figure 5.8 in the printed book, the chart titles were edited as suggested.]</p>\r\n<p>The chart analyzes the location relative to the strike zone of pitches that were missed versus pitches that were hit (not missed). By default, the software takes the name of the binary variable (“Miss”) as the legend title, and lists the values of the variable (“True” and “False”) as the labels of the two colors. Imagine if True appeared as “Miss” and False as “Hit” .</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the chart exhibits over-plotting, making it tough to know how many blue or gray dots are present. Smaller dot size might help, or else some form of aggregation.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1498782752/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=numrulyouwor-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1498782752&amp;linkId=04a3a34f6c08420de8224769e406bfb8\" title=\"Link to Visualizing Baseball\"><em>Visualizing Baseball</em> </a>is not the book for readers who learn by running code as no code is included in the book. A github page by the author hosts the code, but only the R/ggplot2 code for generating the data visualization. Each script begins <em>after</em> the analysis or modeling has been completed. If you already know R and ggplot2, the github is worth a visit. In any case, I don’t recommend learning coding from copying and pasting clean code.</p>\r\n<p>All in all, I can recommend this short book to any <strong>baseball enthusiast who’s beginning to look at baseball data</strong>. It may expand your appreciation of what can be done. For details, and practical implications, look elsewhere.</p>",

I then learned that 2019 is the “International Year of the Periodic Table,” according to the United Nations.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the canonical design of the Periodic Table that science students are familiar with.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4691884200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Wiki-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4691884200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4691884200c-500wi\" style=\"width: 500px;\" title=\"Wiki-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table\" title=\"Link to Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>The Periodic Table is an exercise of information organization and display. It&#39;s about adding structure to over 100 elements, so as to enhance comprehension and lookup. The canonical tabular design has columns and rows. The columns (Groups) impose a primary classification; the rows (Periods) provide a secondary classification. The elements also follow an aggregate order, which is traced by reading from top left to bottom right. The row structure makes clear the &quot;periodicity&quot; of the elements: the &quot;period&quot; of recurrence is not constant, tending to increase with the heavier elements at the bottom.</p>\r\n<p>As with most complex datasets, these elements defy simple organization, due to a curse of dimensionality. The general goal is to <strong>put the similar elements closer together</strong>. Similarity can be defined in an infinite number of ways, such as chemical, physical or statistical properties. The canonical design, usually attributed to Russian chemist Mendeleev, attained its status because the community accepted his organizing principles, that is, his definitions of similarity (subsequently modified).</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Of interest, there is a list of unsettled issues. According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table#Open_questions_and_controversies\" title=\"Link to wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a>, the most common arguments concern:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Hydrogen</em>: typically shown as a member of Group 1 (first column), some argue that it doesn’t belong there since it is a gas not a metal. It is sometimes placed in Group 17 (halogens), where it forms a nice “triad” with fluorine and chlorine. Other designers just float hydrogen up top.</li>\r\n<li><em>Helium</em>: typically shown as a member of Group 18 (rightmost column), the&#0160; <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">halogens</span> noble gases, it may also be placed in Group 2.</li>\r\n<li><em>Mercury</em>: usually found in Group 12, some argue that it is not a metal like cadmium and zinc.</li>\r\n<li><em>Group 3</em>: other than the first two elements , there are various voices about how to place the other elements in Group 3. In particular, the pairs of lanthanum / actinium and lutetium / lawrencium are sometimes shown in the main table, sometimes shown in the ‘f-orbital’ sub-table usually placed below the main table.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, there have been numerous attempts to re-design the Periodic table. Some of these are featured in the article that Chris sent me (<a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/the-periodic-table-could-be-organised-more-like-a-network-than-a-matrix\" title=\"Link to ScienceAlert\">link</a>).</p>\r\n<p>I checked how these alternative designs deal with those unsettled issues. The short answer is they don&#39;t settle the issues.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wide Table (Janet)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The key change is to remove the separation between the main table and the f-orbital (pink) section shown below, as a &quot;footnote&quot;. This change clarifies the periodicity of the elements, especially the elongating periods as one moves down the table. This form is also called &quot;long step&quot;.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4695dad200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Mg32190402_long_conventional\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4695dad200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4695dad200c-500wi\" style=\"width: 500px;\" title=\"Mg32190402_long_conventional\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>As a tradeoff, this table requires more space and has an awkward aspect ratio.</p>\r\n<p>In this version of the wide table, the designer chooses to stack lutetium / lawrencium in Group 3 as part of the main table. Other versions place lanthanum / actinium in Group 3 as part of the main table. There are even versions that leave Group 3 with two elements.</p>\r\n<p>Hydrogen, helium and mercury retain their conventional positions.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spiral Design (Hyde)</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are many attempts at spiral designs. Here is one I found on this <a href=\"https://markcareaga.tumblr.com/post/82358240742/periodic-representation-four-unusual-and\" title=\"Link to Mark Careaga\">tumblr</a>:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a492964e200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Hyde_periodictable\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a492964e200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a492964e200d-500wi\" style=\"width: 500px;\" title=\"Hyde_periodictable\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The spiral leverages the correspondence between periodic and circular. It is visually more pleasing than a tabular arrangement. But there is a tradeoff. Because of the increasing &quot;diameter&quot; from inner to outer rings, the inner elements are visually constrained compared to the outer ones.</p>\r\n<p>In these spiral diagrams, the designer solves the aspect-ratio problem by creating local loops, sometimes called peninsulas. This is analogous to the footnote table solution, and visually distorts the longer periodicity of the heavier elements.</p>\r\n<p>For Hyde&#39;s diagram, hydrogen is floated, helium is assigned to Group 2, and mercury stays in Group 12.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Racetrack</strong></p>\r\n<p>I also found this design on the same <a href=\"https://markcareaga.tumblr.com/post/82358240742/periodic-representation-four-unusual-and\" title=\"Link to Mark Careaga\">tumblr</a>, but unattributed. It may have come from <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_04EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" title=\"Link to Google Books\">Life</a> magazine.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4696035200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Tumblr_n3tbz5rIKk1s3r80lo3_1280\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4696035200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4696035200c-500wi\" style=\"width: 500px;\" title=\"Tumblr_n3tbz5rIKk1s3r80lo3_1280\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>It&#39;s a variant of the spiral. Instead of peninsulas, the designer squeezes the f-orbital section under Group 3, so this is analogous to the wide table solution.</p>\r\n<p>The circular diagrams convey the sense of periodic return but the wide table displays the magnitudes more clearly.</p>\r\n<p>This designer places hydrogen in group 18 forming a triad with fluorine and chlorine. Helium is in Group 17 and mercury in the usual Group 12 .</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cartogram (Sheehan)</strong></p>\r\n<p>This version is different.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b747b7200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Elements_relative_abundance\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b747b7200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b747b7200b-450wi\" style=\"width: 450px;\" title=\"Elements_relative_abundance\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The designer chooses a statistical property (abundance) as the primary organizing principle. The key insight is that the lighter elements in the top few rows are generally more abundant - thus more important in a sense. The cartogram reveals a key weakness of the spiral diagrams that draw the reader&#39;s attention to the outer (heavier) elements.</p>\r\n<p>Because of the distorted shapes, the cartogram form obscures much of the other data. In terms of the unsettled issues, hydrogen and helium are placed in Groups 1 and 2. Mercury is in Group 12. Group 3 is squeezed inside the main table rather than shown below.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Network</strong></p>\r\n<p>The centerpiece of the article Chris sent me is a network graph.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b77eb8200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Periodic-bonds_1024\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b77eb8200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4b77eb8200b-500wi\" style=\"width: 500px;\" title=\"Periodic-bonds_1024\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This is a complete redesign, de-emphasizing the periodicity. It&#39;s a result of radically changing the definition of similarity between elements. One barrier when introducing entirely new displays is the tendency of readers to expect the familiar.</p>\r\n<p><strong>***</strong></p>\r\n<p>I found the following articles useful when researching this post:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-periodic-table-from-its-classic-design-to-use-in-popular-culture-52822\" title=\"Link to the Conversation\">The Conversation</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://eic.rsc.org/feature/trouble-in-the-periodic-table/2020266.article\" title=\"Link to Royal Chemistry Society\">Royal Chemistry Society</a></p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

I then learned that 2019 is the “International Year of the Periodic Table,” according to the United Nations.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the canonical design of the Periodic Table that science students are familiar with.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4691884200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Wiki-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4691884200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4691884200c-500wi\" style=\"width: 500px;\" title=\"Wiki-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table\" title=\"Link to Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>The Periodic Table is an exercise of information organization and display. It&#39;s about adding structure to over 100 elements, so as to enhance comprehension and lookup. The canonical tabular design has columns and rows. The columns (Groups) impose a primary classification; the rows (Periods) provide a secondary classification. The elements also follow an aggregate order, which is traced by reading from top left to bottom right. The row structure makes clear the &quot;periodicity&quot; of the elements: the &quot;period&quot; of recurrence is not constant, tending to increase with the heavier elements at the bottom.</p>\r\n<p>As with most complex datasets, these elements defy simple organization, due to a curse of dimensionality. The general goal is to <strong>put the similar elements closer together</strong>. Similarity can be defined in an infinite number of ways, such as chemical, physical or statistical properties. The canonical design, usually attributed to Russian chemist Mendeleev, attained its status because the community accepted his organizing principles, that is, his definitions of similarity (subsequently modified).</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>Of interest, there is a list of unsettled issues.

It&#39;s a clean, clear way of showing multiple comparisons on the same chart.</p>\r\n<p>You can see the distribution of pay levels of companies within each industry grouping, and the vertical lines showing the sector medians allow comparison across sectors. The median pay levels are quite similar with the energy sector leaning higher, and consumer sector leaning lower.</p>\r\n<p>The consumer sector is extremely heavy on the low side of the pay range.

         "content": "<p>The Bloomberg team has come up with a few goodies lately. I was captivated by the following graphic about the ebb and flow of U.S. presidential candidates across recent campaigns. Link to the full presentation <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/democratic-party-candidates-running-2020-election/\" title=\"Link to Bloomberg\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The highlight is at the bottom of the page. This is an excerpt of the chart:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5f68200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_presidentialcandidates_1\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5f68200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5f68200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_presidentialcandidates_1\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>From top to bottom are the sequential presidential races. The far right vertical axis is the finish line. Going right to left is the time before the finish line. In 2008, for example, there are candidates who entered the race much earlier than typical.</p>\r\n<p>This chart presents an aggregate view of the data. We get a sense of when most of the candidates enter the race, when most of them are knocked out, and also a glimpse of outliers. The general pattern across multiple elections is also clear. The design is a stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/area_chart\" title=\"Posts about area charts\">area chart</a> with the baseline in the middle, rather than the bottom, of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, the chart can disappoint those readers who want details and precise numbers. It&#39;s not immediately apparent how many candidates were in the race at the height of 2008, nor who the candidates were.</p>\r\n<p>The designer added a nice touch. By clicking on any of the stacks, it transforms into a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">bar chart</a>, showing the extent of each candidate&#39;s participation in the race.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5fb0200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_presidentialcandidates_2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5fb0200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5fb0200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_presidentialcandidates_2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>I wish this was a way to collapse the bar chart back to the stack. You can reload the page to start afresh.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>This elegant design touch makes the user experience playful. It&#39;s also an elegant way to present what is essentially a panel of plots.

         "renderedContent": "<p>The Bloomberg team has come up with a few goodies lately. I was captivated by the following graphic about the ebb and flow of U.S. presidential candidates across recent campaigns. Link to the full presentation <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/democratic-party-candidates-running-2020-election/\" title=\"Link to Bloomberg\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The highlight is at the bottom of the page. This is an excerpt of the chart:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5f68200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_presidentialcandidates_1\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5f68200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5f68200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_presidentialcandidates_1\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>From top to bottom are the sequential presidential races. The far right vertical axis is the finish line. Going right to left is the time before the finish line. In 2008, for example, there are candidates who entered the race much earlier than typical.</p>\r\n<p>This chart presents an aggregate view of the data. We get a sense of when most of the candidates enter the race, when most of them are knocked out, and also a glimpse of outliers. The general pattern across multiple elections is also clear. The design is a stacked <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/area_chart\" title=\"Posts about area charts\">area chart</a> with the baseline in the middle, rather than the bottom, of the chart.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, the chart can disappoint those readers who want details and precise numbers. It&#39;s not immediately apparent how many candidates were in the race at the height of 2008, nor who the candidates were.</p>\r\n<p>The designer added a nice touch. By clicking on any of the stacks, it transforms into a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">bar chart</a>, showing the extent of each candidate&#39;s participation in the race.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5fb0200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_presidentialcandidates_2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5fb0200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e5fb0200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_presidentialcandidates_2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>I wish this was a way to collapse the bar chart back to the stack. You can reload the page to start afresh.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>This elegant design touch makes the user experience playful. It&#39;s also an elegant way to present what is essentially a panel of plots. Imagine the more traditional presentation of placing the stack and the bar chart side by side.</p>\r\n<p>This design does not escape the trade-off between entertainment value and data integrity. Looking at the 2004 campaign, one should expect to see the blue stack halve in size around day 100 when Kerry became the last man standing. That moment is not marked in the stack. The stack can be interpreted as a <em>smoothed</em> version of the count of active candidates.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e6347200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_bloombergpresidentialcandidates_3\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e6347200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45e6347200c-350wi\" style=\"width: 350px;\" title=\"Redo_bloombergpresidentialcandidates_3\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>I suppose some may complain the stack misrepresents the data somewhat.

         "content": "<p>Bloomberg featured a thought-provoking <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-uk-gender-pay-gap/\" title=\"Link to Bloomberg\">dataviz</a> that illustrates the pay gap by gender in the U.K. The dataset underlying this effort is complex, and the designers did a good job simplifying the data for ease of comprehension.</p>\r\n<p>U.K. companies are required to submit data on salaries and bonuses by gender, and by pay quartiles. The dataset is incomplete, since some companies are slow to report, and the analyst decided not to merge companies that changed names.</p>\r\n<p>Companies are classified into industry groups. Readers who read Chapter 3 of <span style=\"color: #438059;\"><strong>Numbers Rule Your World</strong></span> (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2zssjj4\" title=\"Link to Amazon\">link</a>) should ask whether these group differences are meaningful by themselves, without controlling for seniority, job titles, etc. The chapter features one method used by the educational testing industry to take a more nuanced analysis of group differences.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The Bloomberg visualization has two sections. In the top section, each company is represented by the percent difference between average female pay and average male pay. Then the companies within a given industry is shown in a histogram. The histograms provide a view of the disparity between companies within a given industry. The black line represents the relative proportion of companies in a given industry that have no gender pay gap but it’s the weight of the histogram on either side of the black line that carries the graphic’s message.</p>\r\n<p>This is the histogram for arts, entertainment and recreation.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5dc3200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_arts\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5dc3200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5dc3200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_arts\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The spread within this industry is very wide, especially on the left side of the black line. A large proportion of these companies pay women less on average than men, and how much less is highly variable. There is one extreme positive value: Chelsea FC Foundation that pays the average female about 40% more than the average male.</p>\r\n<p>This is the histogram for the public sector.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5df4200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_public\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5df4200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5df4200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_public\" /></a><br />It is a much tighter distribution, meaning that the pay gaps vary less from organization to organization (this statement ignores the possibility that there are outliers not visible on this graphic). Again, the vast majority of entities in this sector pay women less than men on average.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The second part of the visualization look at the quartile data. The employees of each company are divided into four equal-sized groups, based on their wages. Think of these groups as the Top 25% Earners, the Second 25%, etc. Within each group, the analyst looks at the proportion of women. If gender is independent of pay, then we should expect the proportions of women to be about the same for all four quartiles. (This analysis considers gender to be the only explainer for pay gaps. This is a problem I&#39;ve called <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/xyopia\" title=\"Posts about xyopia\">xyopia</a>, that frames a complex multivariate issue as a bivariate problem involving one outcome and one explanatory variable. Chapter 3 of&#0160;<span style=\"color: #438059;\"><strong>Numbers Rule Your World</strong></span> (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2zssjj4\" title=\"Link to Amazon\">link</a>) discusses how statisticians approach this issue.)</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868e9f200d-pi\" style=\"float: right;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_public_pie\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868e9f200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868e9f200d-200wi\" style=\"width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_public_pie\" /></a>On the right is the chart for the public sector. This is a pie chart used as a container. Every pie has four equal-sized slices representing the four quartiles of pay.</p>\r\n<p>The female proportion is encoded in both the size and color of the pie slices. The size encoding is more precise while the color encoding has only 4 levels so it provides a “binned” summary view of the same data.</p>\r\n<p>For the public sector, the lighter-colored slice shows the top 25% earners, and its light color means the proportion of women in the top 25% earners group is between 30 and 50 percent. As we move clockwise around the pie, the slices represent the 2nd, 3rd and bottom 25% earners, and women form 50 to 70 percent of each of those three quartiles.</p>\r\n<p>To read this chart properly, <strong>the reader must first do one calculation</strong>. Women represent about 60% of the top 25% earners in the public sector. Is that good or bad? This depends on the overall representation of women in the public sector. If the sector employs 75 percent women overall, then the 60 percent does not look good but if it employs 40 percent women, then the same value of 60% tells us that the female employees are disproportionately found in the top 25% earners.</p>\r\n<p>That means the reader must compare each value in the pie chart against the overall proportion of women, which is learned from the average of the four quartiles.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In the chart below, I make this relative <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/comparability\" title=\"Posts about comparability\">comparison</a> explicit. The overall proportion of women in each industry is shown using an open dot. Then the graphic displays two <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">bars</a>, one for the Top 25% earners, and one for the Bottom 25% earners. The bars show the gap between those quartiles and the overall female proportion. For the top earners, the size of the red bars shows the degree of under-representation of women while for the bottom earners, the size of the gray bars shows the degree of over-representation of women.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868f64200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_junkcharts_bloombergukgendergap\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868f64200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868f64200d-500wi\" style=\"width: 500px;\" title=\"Redo_junkcharts_bloombergukgendergap\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The net sum of the bar lengths is a plausible measure of gender inequality.</p>\r\n<p>The industries are <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/sorting\" title=\"Posts about order\">sorted</a> from the ones employing fewer women (at the top) to the ones employing the most women (at the bottom). An alternative is to sort by total bar lengths. In the original Bloomberg chart - the small multiples of pie charts, the industries are sorted by the proportion of women in the bottom 25% pay quartile, from smallest to largest.</p>\r\n<p>In making this dataviz, I elected to ignore the middle 50%. This is not a problem since any quartile above the average must be compensated by a different quartile below the average.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The challenge of complex datasets is discovering simple ways to convey the underlying message. This usually requires quite a bit of upfront analytics, data transformation, and lots of sketching.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

The black line represents the relative proportion of companies in a given industry that have no gender pay gap but it’s the weight of the histogram on either side of the black line that carries the graphic’s message.</p>\r\n<p>This is the histogram for arts, entertainment and recreation.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5dc3200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_arts\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5dc3200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5dc3200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_arts\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The spread within this industry is very wide, especially on the left side of the black line. A large proportion of these companies pay women less on average than men, and how much less is highly variable. There is one extreme positive value: Chelsea FC Foundation that pays the average female about 40% more than the average male.</p>\r\n<p>This is the histogram for the public sector.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5df4200c-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_public\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5df4200c img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a45d5df4200c-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_public\" /></a><br />It is a much tighter distribution, meaning that the pay gaps vary less from organization to organization (this statement ignores the possibility that there are outliers not visible on this graphic). Again, the vast majority of entities in this sector pay women less than men on average.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The second part of the visualization look at the quartile data. The employees of each company are divided into four equal-sized groups, based on their wages. Think of these groups as the Top 25% Earners, the Second 25%, etc. Within each group, the analyst looks at the proportion of women. If gender is independent of pay, then we should expect the proportions of women to be about the same for all four quartiles. (This analysis considers gender to be the only explainer for pay gaps. This is a problem I&#39;ve called <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/xyopia\" title=\"Posts about xyopia\">xyopia</a>, that frames a complex multivariate issue as a bivariate problem involving one outcome and one explanatory variable. Chapter 3 of&#0160;<span style=\"color: #438059;\"><strong>Numbers Rule Your World</strong></span> (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2zssjj4\" title=\"Link to Amazon\">link</a>) discusses how statisticians approach this issue.)</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868e9f200d-pi\" style=\"float: right;\"><img alt=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_public_pie\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868e9f200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868e9f200d-200wi\" style=\"width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;\" title=\"Bloomberg_genderpaygap_public_pie\" /></a>On the right is the chart for the public sector. This is a pie chart used as a container. Every pie has four equal-sized slices representing the four quartiles of pay.</p>\r\n<p>The female proportion is encoded in both the size and color of the pie slices. The size encoding is more precise while the color encoding has only 4 levels so it provides a “binned” summary view of the same data.</p>\r\n<p>For the public sector, the lighter-colored slice shows the top 25% earners, and its light color means the proportion of women in the top 25% earners group is between 30 and 50 percent. As we move clockwise around the pie, the slices represent the 2nd, 3rd and bottom 25% earners, and women form 50 to 70 percent of each of those three quartiles.</p>\r\n<p>To read this chart properly, <strong>the reader must first do one calculation</strong>. Women represent about 60% of the top 25% earners in the public sector. Is that good or bad? This depends on the overall representation of women in the public sector. If the sector employs 75 percent women overall, then the 60 percent does not look good but if it employs 40 percent women, then the same value of 60% tells us that the female employees are disproportionately found in the top 25% earners.</p>\r\n<p>That means the reader must compare each value in the pie chart against the overall proportion of women, which is learned from the average of the four quartiles.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>In the chart below, I make this relative <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/comparability\" title=\"Posts about comparability\">comparison</a> explicit. The overall proportion of women in each industry is shown using an open dot. Then the graphic displays two <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/bar_chart\" title=\"Posts about bar charts\">bars</a>, one for the Top 25% earners, and one for the Bottom 25% earners. The bars show the gap between those quartiles and the overall female proportion. For the top earners, the size of the red bars shows the degree of under-representation of women while for the bottom earners, the size of the gray bars shows the degree of over-representation of women.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868f64200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Redo_junkcharts_bloombergukgendergap\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868f64200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4868f64200d-500wi\" style=\"width: 500px;\" title=\"Redo_junkcharts_bloombergukgendergap\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The net sum of the bar lengths is a plausible measure of gender inequality.</p>\r\n<p>The industries are <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/sorting\" title=\"Posts about order\">sorted</a> from the ones employing fewer women (at the top) to the ones employing the most women (at the bottom). An alternative is to sort by total bar lengths. In the original Bloomberg chart - the small multiples of pie charts, the industries are sorted by the proportion of women in the bottom 25% pay quartile, from smallest to largest.</p>\r\n<p>In making this dataviz, I elected to ignore the middle 50%. This is not a problem since any quartile above the average must be compensated by a different quartile below the average.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The challenge of complex datasets is discovering simple ways to convey the underlying message. This usually requires quite a bit of upfront analytics, data transformation, and lots of sketching.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

         "content": "<p>I enjoyed the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/nyt\" title=\"Commentary on NYT Graphics\">New York Times</a>&#39;s data viz showing how actively the Democratic candidates were criss-crossing the nation in the month of March (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/05/us/politics/2020-democrats-campaign-stops.html\" title=\"Link to New York Times\">link</a>).</p>\r\n<p>It is a great example of layering the presentation, starting with an eye-catching <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/map\" title=\"Posts about maps\">map</a> at the most <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/aggregation\" title=\"Posts about aggregation\">aggregate</a> level. The designers looped through the same dataset three times.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a68d4f200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Nyt_candidatemap_1\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a68d4f200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a68d4f200b-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Nyt_candidatemap_1\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This compact display packs quite a lot. We can easily identify which were the most popular states; and which candidate visited which states the most.</p>\r\n<p>I noticed how they handled the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/legend\" title=\"Posts about legend\">legend</a>. There is no explicit legend. The candidate names are spread around the map. The size legend is also missing, replaced by a short sentence explaining that size encodes the number of cities visited within the state. For a chart like this, having a precise size legend isn&#39;t that useful.</p>\r\n<p>The next section presents the same data in a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/small-multiples\" title=\"Posts about small multiples\">small-multiples</a> layout. The heads are replaced by dots.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a481f1ec200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Nyt_candidatemap_2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a481f1ec200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a481f1ec200d-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Nyt_candidatemap_2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This allows more precise comparison of one candidate to another, and one location to another.</p>\r\n<p>This display has one shortcoming.

         "renderedContent": "<p>I enjoyed the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/nyt\" title=\"Commentary on NYT Graphics\">New York Times</a>&#39;s data viz showing how actively the Democratic candidates were criss-crossing the nation in the month of March (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/05/us/politics/2020-democrats-campaign-stops.html\" title=\"Link to New York Times\">link</a>).</p>\r\n<p>It is a great example of layering the presentation, starting with an eye-catching <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/map\" title=\"Posts about maps\">map</a> at the most <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/aggregation\" title=\"Posts about aggregation\">aggregate</a> level. The designers looped through the same dataset three times.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a68d4f200b-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Nyt_candidatemap_1\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a68d4f200b img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a4a68d4f200b-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Nyt_candidatemap_1\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This compact display packs quite a lot. We can easily identify which were the most popular states; and which candidate visited which states the most.</p>\r\n<p>I noticed how they handled the <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/legend\" title=\"Posts about legend\">legend</a>. There is no explicit legend. The candidate names are spread around the map. The size legend is also missing, replaced by a short sentence explaining that size encodes the number of cities visited within the state. For a chart like this, having a precise size legend isn&#39;t that useful.</p>\r\n<p>The next section presents the same data in a <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/small-multiples\" title=\"Posts about small multiples\">small-multiples</a> layout. The heads are replaced by dots.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a481f1ec200d-pi\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Nyt_candidatemap_2\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a481f1ec200d img-responsive\" src=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef0240a481f1ec200d-450wi\" style=\"width: 425px;\" title=\"Nyt_candidatemap_2\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This allows more precise comparison of one candidate to another, and one location to another.</p>\r\n<p>This display has one shortcoming. If you compare the left two <a href=\"https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/map\">maps</a> above, those for Amy Klobuchar and Beto O&#39;Rourke, it looks like they have visited roughly similar number of cities when in fact Beto went to 42 compared to 25.
